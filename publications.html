            <p class="pub_summary">Prompted by the discovery of a previously undisclosed methodological ambiguity in the Census of Agriculture, a fresh compilation of farmland, cropland and land tenure among individual crop farms in every county of California finds a substantially greater degree of size concentration than previously reported. Among the state's largest farms, all but a handful are locally-based, family-owned businesses that have been able to expand, mostly by leasing land, to take advantage of the expanding market for the state's abundant output of food and fiber. A detailed review of Anderson Farms Company provides insight about how outside capital was successfully leveraged by a third-generation Yolo County farmer into a multi-million dollar enterpise.<a href="Fulltext/Getting_Bigger_Large_Scale_Farming_in_California.pdf.pdf">   Link to Full Text</a></p>

            </p><p class="pub_summary">Since 1940, California agricultural has expanded at a remarably rapid pace, doubling the amount of irriganted land, and witnessed the remakable dominance of large-scale farms: in 1987 the largest 7% of the state's farms produced two-thirds of all crop and livestock output (based on value of farm cash receipts from the sale of agricultural commodities). Within the spouthern San Joaquin Valley region where Prof. Goldschmidt's classic study was conducted, the number of farms with at least 2,000 acres of cropland has increased ten-fold. This paper was presented at a conference honoring Prof. Goldschmidt and reflecting on his research contributions.  <A HREF=Fulltext/Agriculture_Community_A-Little-Piece-of-Land_Villarejo_Questions-to-panel_02-08-91.pdf>Link to Symposium- text version</A> </p>

        <p class="pub_summary">This report assesses the risk factors for California farm operators by examining farm operator turnover for two California counties. Turnover and attrition rates are found to be quite high in both counties, while farm start-ups are also very high. Economic instability is found to be more prevalent in certain crops, farm sizes, and ethnic groups, providing a picture of who will be at greatest risk of economic failure in farming.   <A HREF=Fulltext/On_Shaky_Ground_Farm_Operator_Turnover_in_California_Agriculture.PDF>Link to Full Text</A></p>

            </p><p class="pub_summary">During the period 1978 to 2000, many of California's largest farms, based on size of cropland under cultivation, had gone out of business, or had been merged into one of their peers. A consequence of these changes is that size concentration has become even greater: in 1997 the largest 6.5% of the state's farms accounted for three-fourths of all food and fiber (measured by farm cash receipts from the marketing of agricltural commodities). Morever, contract labor and other types of contracted agricultral service providers are inceasingly replacing directly hired on-farm workers. This invited paper was presented at a conference sponsoded by the Agricultural Labor Relations Board to commemorate the 25th Anniversary of the California Agricultural Labor Relations Act.   <A HREF=Fulltext/California_Farm_Employers_25_Years_Later_12-06-00.pdf>Link to Full Text</A></p>

Motivated by Congressional deliberations over the 1990 Farm Bill, the every-five-year legislation which establishes Federal farm policy, the author argues the fundamental values of working-class urban residents are actually closely aligned with those who live on farmer-worked plots of land. Whether it is bankers who charge high interest rates on loans to farmers or to city homeowners, middlemen and supermakets who buy low and sell high, or chemical manufacturers whose products may pose serious threats to people and our shared environment, city and rural dwellers should reaiize they have a lot in common. <A HREF="Fulltext/News-Article_Rural_Urban_Divisions_Villarejo.pdf">Link to Full Text</A></p>

            </p><p class="pub_summary">Firebaugh, a community located on the west side of the San Jaoquin Valley, faced serious policy changes in the late 1990s when this preliminary study was completed. On the one hand, the Firebaugh Zip Code area encompasses over 200,000 acres of irrigated cropland, which is increasingly dedicated to fresh and processed vegatable and fruit production. On the other hand, evidence of buildup of salts in the soil poses a threat to the continued viability of irrigaged agriculture; some advocates claim this soil contamination presents a threat to the health of residents. This paper describes these challenges. Meanwhile the population of foreign-born residents continues to increase rapidly as a result of the demand for labor needs of intensive crop production.   <A HREF="Fulltext/Firebaugh_Community_Case_Study_Preliminary_Findings.pdf">Link to Full Text</A></p>

            </p><p class="pub_summary">The southern San Joaquin Valley has a little known history of mid-Twentieth Century tension between long-settled non-Hispanic white residents and newly arrived immigrants from Mexico. Small enclaves of the new settlers formed outside of municipal boundaries, where some lacked basic sanitatoin services. Pockets of of these rural slums remain today, where many residents of sub-stsandard housing eke out a livelihood at or below the official poverty level.

          </p><p class="pub_summary">The rapid expansion of almond plantings in the Sacamento and San Joaquin Valleys has fueled a debate between water conservation environmental advocates and agricultural interests. This 1989 Declaration describes the growth of almond acreage, which was stimulated in part by the availability of abundent supplies of Fedarally-provided, publicly subsidized, irrigation water. Some farmers who were members of the California Action Network believed they were harmed by overproduction of almonds, which drove down prices they received for their crops.  <a href=Fulltext/Reclamation_Policy_Almond_Plantings_Declaration_Villarejo_1989.pdf>Link to Full Text</a></p>

      <p class="pub_summary">There is evidence that some agricultural employers deliberately understate the payroll amount on which employment taxes are based. Self-reported information provided by 180 representative labor contacttors during interviews conducted in 1990 was compared with EDD records for each employer. There was a systematic difference between the two records for many of the employers who were interviewed, biased toward larger values of self-reported payrolls. Nearly all of the employers who were interviewed were licensed farm labor contractos in California, only a very few lacked the required state license.   <A HREF="Fulltext/Agriculture_s_Underground_Economy.pdf.pdf">Link to Full Text</A></p>

      <p class="publication">Congressional Testimony, U.S. House of Representatives, Committee on Resources, April 15, 1998.</p>
      <p class="pub_summary">This invited testimony before the U.S. House of Representatives, Committee on Resources, focused on the failure of policy makers to address the negative social and eocnomic impacts on farm communities in rural California when local irrigation water supplies are permanently cutback and diverted to non-agricultural uses. The CIRS study of the impact of the 1987-2002 drought, a climate effect, not of policy, but of natural causes, led to a sharsp decline of local wage income and employment, of city sales taxes, and of local business revenues. It is argued that neglect of rural communities when discussing transfers of irrigation water away from agriculture use has seriously implications for rural famillies.   <a HREF="Fulltext/Committee-on-Resources_April-15-1998-Testimony-of-Don-Villarejo.html">   Link to Full Text</a></p></p>

Consumption of canned and other types of processing has plunged during this period. For some vegatbles, notably excluding tomatoes, a similar decrease of consumer prefernce is also apparent. Increasingly, consumers prefer value-added, fresh or fresh-cut produce, typically sold as triple-washed in relatively small bags. The rapidity of this adjustment by consumers suggests that convinence in meal preparation outwieighs the increased costs of the newer forms of distribution.   <a HREF=Fulltext/Kick_the_Can_Production_and_Employment_in_the_Wesdt_Coast_Fruit_and_Vegetable_Processing_Industries.pdf.pdf>Link to Full Text</a></p>

The Criticque concludes that these estimates were flawed, incorreclty underestimating both the total number of workers as well as their distribution among the states.   <a HREF="Fulltext/Critique_Martin-Holt_Migrant_Farmworker_Enumeration_Villarejo_Estrada_Barnett_05-13-87.pdf">   Link to Full Text</a></p>

        <p class="pub_summary">This Research report, published in 1992 and supported by a contract with the California Department of Employment Development, examined the status of the Farm Labor Contractor industry in California. Personal face-to-face interviews were conducted among more 300 farm labor contractors, their employees and their grower clients. Interview participants were careflly selected to represent the major agricultural regions where labor contactors are reportedly active. Findings include the discovery that many licensed farm labor contractors, about one-fourth, are active in a wide range of types of agricultural businesses: some are also growers, some operate trucking businesses to haul crops to markets or for processing, still others are active in non-agricultural businesses ranging from restaurants to temporary employment agencies. Contrary to reports by some labor advocates, only a tiny fraction of contactors - defined as those who hire, supervise and pay wages - are unlicensed.

        <p class="pub_summary">The California Agricultural Worker Health Survey (CAWHS) is a statewide health study of 971 California farm workers that was conducted by CIRS in 1999 with funding from <a href="http://www.calendow.org/">The California Endowment</a>. The survey represents the first randomized health study of farmworkers conducted in the United States. The survey encompassed: (1) levels of health care utilization by the participants' household; (2) current health status; (3) work history; (4) immigration status; (5) workplace conditions and training; (6) housing conditions; (7) wage rates and household income; and (8) occupational conditions, safety training, and injuries. Participants were also asked to participate in physical exams where baseline data on blood chemistry was collected. This landmark study brings the health crisis affecting California's farmworkers to the fore and provides the first-ever baseline health data for farmworkers in California.

          <p class="pub_summary">Labor market conflict in California agriculture eventually led to enactment of the California Agricultural Labor Relations Act in 1975. As a result, conflict in the fields, and at the negotiating table, came under the jurisdiction of government-administered procedures. This paper describes how the fight in the fields subsequently became a fight for control of this agency and, ultimately, a political struggle in the California legislature. By tracking the decisions and rule-making by the Agricultural Labor Relations Board, and its appointees, the power of organized labor sharply decline, and fewer agricultural workers were represented by labor unions than before the 1975 law was enacted.   <a HREF="Fulltext/Wells_Villarejo_Politics_Society_Sept_2004.pdf">   Link to Full Text</a></p>

            <p class="pub_summary">The Napa County Board of Supervisors commissoined this study of the demand for farm labor housing in Napa County, the state's leading region for the production of premium-quality wine. The research included face-to-face interviews with 200 farm workers during the 2006 winegrape harvest, and interviews with 158 growers, farm labor contractors and vineyard management companies. Crowded housing conditions were commonplace among farmworkers, and a substantial number lived in adjancent or distant counties owing, in major part, to the lack of safe, decent and affordable houing in the county. Both employers and workers agreed that meeting the housing needs of the seasonally-employed workforce was the single most important goal for Napa County.   <a HREF="Fulltext/Napa-County_Farm-Worker_Housing_Assessment_03-31-07.pdf">   Link to Full Text</a></p>

Some 205 workers and 100 farm employers were interviewed. Most winegrape prouction in the county is among relatively small producers, unlike other major winegrape prodcution counties in the state.

          <p class="pub_summary">This report was presented at the annual meeting of the Society for Applied Anthropology in 2009, and reports the findings of the California Agricultural Workers Health Survey regarding utilization of health care services according to immigration status. Findings were from 970 face-to-face interviews of randomly selected participants. The findings cleasrly demonstrate disproportionately fewer undocumened male workers had sought and used health services in the U.S. than was the case for male citizen and documeted workers. In contrast, the proportion of undocumented female workers who accessed U.S. health care services was not starticially different than the proprtion of female citizend workres. It is suggested that California's Emergency Medi-Cal program that provides free pre-natal and post-delivery care for mothers and their newborns accounts for this achievement.    <a HREF="Fulltext/Health_Care_Access_Undocumented_Farm_Workers_figures-statistics-attached_Villarejo.pdf">   Link to Full Text</a></p>

          <p class="pub_summary">Reviwing the economic status and the decades-long absence of labor actions by California's hired farm workers, the author suggests the "labor vs. capital" model of labor organizing may have become obsolete for agricultural workers. Moreover, with the dramatic shift of food purchases to meals prepared outside the home instead of those cooked at home, the "value added" sector may become a locus of consumer-worker pressure to improve wages and working conditions. Already, the Coalition of Immokalee Workers have won real gains in earnings for those workers involved in the southeastern U.S. fresh tomato harvest, mainly in Florida, as a result of consumer-worker pressure on fast-food and some mass-market discount stores.

        <p class="pub_summary">This invited paper was presented at conference in Washington, DC, on March 27, 1993, at the USDA headquarters. The main points are that U.S. fruit, vegatable and ornamental horticulture production continues to increase; the corresponding increase of the demand for farm labor is readily demonstrated; and the pool of farm workers of the future is located outside of U.S. borders. Thus, immigrant workers will become an even greater share of the U.S. farm labor force than is the case today.

      <p class="publication">Employer Sanction Citations in California Agriculture, September 11, 1997</p>
        <p class="pub_summary">Employer sanctions were a key part of the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 which authorized penalties if an employer "knowlingly hired" an individual who lacked authorization for U.S. employment. This report presents an analysis of the Employer Sanctions Data Base assembled by the Center for Immigration Studies from the INS Case Closed File. Data from FY1988 through FY1999 were available for this analysis. The main findings with respect employers of agricultural workers suggested that fewer than 1.25% of California employers of farm workers were cited per year. In contrast, the National Agricultural Workers Survey (NAWS) finds about 42% of Californina crop workers told official government intreviews during FY1995-FY1997 they were not authorized for U.S. employment.

          <p class="pub_summary">Employer sanctions enforcement, espacially fining practices are reviewed in the context of IRCA and the post-9/11 experience. The authors conclude that enforcement activity has been minimal, likely not sufficient to deter futue violatoins of law. Moreover, enforcement activity appears to be newly aimed at workers in which employers are permitted to demand that workers produce adequate documentation if their I-9 Forms appear suspicious. Workers who fail to produce adequate documentation are then subject to immediate dismissal.

      <p class="pub_summary">Supported by The Ford Foundation, this reserach examines complinace with the acreage limitation provisions of the 1982 Reclamation Reform Act which allowed farmers to receive Federally subsidized irrigation water on no more than 960 acres per farm. Primary data was compiled for named owners and/or farmers on every tract within ten water or irrigation districts in California's Central valley. The findings suggest that most landowners and farrmers were in compliance, but a relative handful (13%) of large-scale owners and/or farmers control nearly two-thirds (62%) of the Federally irrigated land in these ten districts.  The final chapter of this report examines changes in agricultural land ownership between 1940 and 1982 in the entire three-county area comprising Kern, Kings and Tulare Counties. During this period, more than one million acres were brought under irrigations with Federal water for the first time. The main finding is that just 4.1% of the agricultural owners controlled a majority (52%) of the farmland of the three counties.   <a href="Fulltext/How_Much_Is_Enough_Federal_Water_Subsidies_and_Agriculture_in_California_s_Central_Valley.pdf.pdf">Link to Full Text</a></p>

This report reviewed current agricultural practices and discusses trends toward greater produciton of fruits, nuts, vegetables, dairy products, and a few other commodities. Non-bearsing acreage of trees and vines indicate further near term expansion. On the other hand, farmers are facing higher water costs, as well as the chronic cost-price squeeze which affects most commodities. Finally, increasing foreign demand for some agriculture commodities may be adversley affected by possible trade disputes.

          <p class="pub_summary">Enforcement of safety and health regulations in the workplace is presumed to encourage employers to engage their employees in safe practices. Cal-OSHA is the lead agency carrying out worksite inspections and levying fines if violations are found. During 1993 and 1994, a multi-agency task force, the Targetted Industries Partnersip Program, led by the Labor Commissioner, including Cal-OSHA, conducted substantial inspections in agriculture. This Executive Summary and full report present an analysis of the type of violations discovered and the types of sanctions imposed. Recommendations for future interventions are also discussed.

          <p class="pub_summary">This short paper smmarizes initial findings of research on the prevalence of occupational injuries and illnesses among minor children employed as hired farm workers. Data from the National Agricultural Workers Survey indicates a relatively low prevalence nationally and an even lower pevalence in California. The paper suggests the strong regulatory requirements imposed in California may be responsible for the lower rate in California.

        <p class="publication">Environmental Health Policy and California's Farm Labor Housing, by Don Villarejo, Marc Schenker, John Muir Institute on the Environment, Unviersity of California, Davis, May 1, 2007</p>
          <p class="pub_summary">This review was commissioned by the John Muir Institute on the Environment of The University of California. The review of the recent scientific literature on farm labor housing in California indicates most workers reside off-farm in private market housing. But many workers are found to live in crowded or extremely crowded conditions, often with sevreal unrelated persons who, as boarders, share the dwelling and its facilities. Following a discussion of some adverse health outcomes associated with those living conditions, the authors suggest eight policy initiatives to improve the living conditions of Californina's agricultural workforce.  <a HREF="Fulltext/Environmental_Health_Policy_Farm_Labor_Housing_Villareo-Schenker_2007.pdf">   Link to Full Text</a></p>

              <p class="pub_summary">Published in the Journal of Agriculturla Safety and Health, this report summarizes occupational health findigs in a survey of 970 randomly identified hired farm workers in which the response rate was 83%. An occupational injury during the 12-months preceding the interview was reported by 6% of the men and 2% of the women. Self-reported health conditions include persistent pain (daily for one week) in a the back, neck, knees, shoulders, hand, feet or multiple body parts. Reports of exposures to pesticide sprays were associated with irritated, itchy or watery eyes. Some workers reported helath conditions associated with being forced to taste unwashed grapes to determined its degree of sweetness.   <a href="Fulltext/The_California_Agricultral_Workers_Health_Survey(CAWHS)_2008.pdf">Link to Survey</a></p>

        <p class="publication">Heat-related Occupational Illnesses in California Agriculture: Prevention and Regulatory Effectiveness, April 27, 2009</p>
          <p class="pub_summary">During the mid-1990s, there were several periods of persistend, extreme, high heat conditions in the agricultural regions of California's San Joaquin Valley and Desert areas. Regrettably, the prevalence of occupational fatalities caused by heath stroke or heat exhaustion rose sharply at those times. California's Governor Schwartznegger was prompted to order Emergency High-Heat Illness Prevention regulations which were later officially approved by state agencies. This paper reviews Cal-OSHA information of each fatal case among agricultural workers and finds indications of systematic, inadequate enforcement.

          <p class="pub_summary">California Rural Legal Assistance, Inc., commissioned this comprehensive review of health risks to residents of dwellings, whether farmworkers or not, that have any kind of specific, substandard features: structural flaws, environmental pollutants or lack basic residential services. Absent comprehensive, nationally representative housing surveys which include direct, third-party measures of residents' health status, it proved necessary to cite case studies of farm worker housing where specific, substandard features were reported to infer the likely adverse health outcomes among residents. Recommendations included the urgent need for a nationally representive survey of farmworker housing.

              <p class="pub_summary">Published by the California Institute for Rural Studies, this paper expands on the invited remarks by Don Villarejo at the July 16, 2013 conference of California Rural Legal Assistance at the Asilomar conference center. The main findings are that all but a relative handful of the state's hired farm workers now reside in market housing, which has effectively shifted the responsibility and cost of housing from employers to workers. A consequnece of this change from employer supported housing to private market housing in a state with notoriously expensive housing is that a very large share of workers share dwellings with unrelated workers, which is associated with extremely crowded conditions.
