            <p class="pub_summary">Prompted by the discovery of a previously undisclosed methodological ambiguity in the Census of Agriculture, a fresh compilation of farmland, cropland and land tenure among individual crop farms in every county of California finds a substantially greater degree of size concentration than previously reported. Among the state's largest farms, all but a handful are locally-based, family-owned businesses that have been able to expand, mostly by leasing land, to take advantage of the expanding market for the state's abundant output of food and fiber. A detailed review of Anderson Farms Company provides insight about how outside capital was successfully leveraged by a third-generation Yolo County farmer into a multi-million dollar enterpise.<a href="Fulltext/CIRS_Collected_Papers/Getting_Bigger_Large_Scale_Farming_in_California.pdf.pdf">   Link to Full Text</a></p>

          <p class="pub_summary">San Diego County agriculural production substantially increased during the early and mid-1980s, despite rapid urban growth. Land degignated for development was not being used for crop production. Losses of farmland were primarily among filed and livstock production.

As a result, agricultural employment in the region has increased as well.

        <p class="pub_summary">Of California's twenty largest farms in 1978, only seven remained intact in 1989. Yet most of the land remained in agriculture, albeit with new management. This Working Paper draws attention to the structural changes taking place in California agriculture, and their impact on the farm labor market.

            </p><p class="pub_summary">Since 1940, California agricultural has expanded at a remarably rapid pace, doubling the amount of irriganted land, and witnessed the remakable dominance of large-scale farms: in 1987 the largest 7% of the state's farms produced two-thirds of all crop and livestock output (based on value of farm cash receipts from the sale of agricultural commodities). Within the spouthern San Joaquin Valley region where Prof. Goldschmidt's classic study was conducted, the number of farms with at least 2,000 acres of cropland has increased ten-fold. This paper was presented at a conference honoring Prof. Goldschmidt and reflecting on his research contributions.  <A HREF=Fulltext/Agriculture_Community_A-Little-Piece-of-Land_Villarejo_Questions-to-panel_02-08-91.pdf>Link to Symposium- text version</A> </p>

        <p class="pub_summary">This report assesses the risk factors for California farm operators by examining farm operator turnover for two California counties. Turnover and attrition rates are found to be quite high in both counties, while farm start-ups are also very high. Economic instability is found to be more prevalent in certain crops, farm sizes, and ethnic groups, providing a picture of who will be at greatest risk of economic failure in farming.   <A HREF=Fulltext/CIRS_Collected_Papers/On_Shaky_Ground_Farm_Operator_Turnover_in_California_Agriculture.PDF>Link to Full Text</A></p>

            </p><p class="pub_summary">During the period 1978 to 2000, many of California's largest farms, based on size of cropland under cultivation, had gone out of business, or had been merged into one of their peers. A consequence of these changes is that size concentration has become even greater: in 1997 the largest 6.5% of the state's farms accounted for three-fourths of all food and fiber (measured by farm cash receipts from the marketing of agricltural commodities). Morever, contract labor and other types of contracted agricultral service providers are inceasingly replacing directly hired on-farm workers. This invited paper was presented at a conference sponsoded by the Agricultural Labor Relations Board to commemorate the 25th Anniversary of the California Agricultural Labor Relations Act.   <A HREF=Fulltext/California_Farm_Employers_25_Years_Later_12-06-00.pdf>Link to Full Text</A></p>

            </p><p class="pub_summary">Firebaugh, a community located on the west side of the San Jaoquin Valley, faced serious policy changes in the late 1990s when this preliminary study was completed. On the one hand, the Firebaugh Zip Code area encompasses over 200,000 acres of irrigated cropland, which is increasingly dedicated to fresh and processed vegatable and fruit production. On the other hand, evidence of buildup of salts in the soil poses a threat to the continued viability of irrigaged agriculture; some advocates claim this soil contamination presents a threat to the health of residents. This paper describes these challenges. Meanwhile the population of foreign-born residents continues to increase rapidly as a result of the demand for labor needs of intensive crop production.   <A HREF="Fulltext/Firebaugh_Community_Case_Study_Preliminary_Findings.pdf">Link to Full Text</A></p>

            </p><p class="pub_summary">The southern San Joaquin Valley has a little known history of mid-Twentieth Century tension between long-settled non-Hispanic white residents and newly arrived immigrants from Mexico. Small enclaves of the new settlers formed outside of municipal boundaries, where some lacked basic sanitatoin services. Pockets of of these rural slums remain today, where many residents of sub-stsandard housing eke out a livelihood at or below the official poverty level. Policy options are also discussed.   <a HREF=Fulltext/Ramirez_Villarejo_California_Rural_Slums_e-pub_AJPH.2012_July19.pdf>   Link to Full Text</a></p>

          </p><p class="pub_summary">The rapid expansion of almond plantings in the Sacamento and San Joaquin Valleys has fueled a debate between water conservation environmental advocates and agricultural interests. This 1989 Declaration describes the growth of almond acreage, which was stimulated in part by the availability of abundent supplies of Fedarally-provided, publicly subsidized, irrigation water. Some farmers who were members of the California Action Network believed they were harmed by overproduction of almonds, which drove down prices they received for their crops.  <a href=Fulltext/Reclamation_Policy_Almond_Plantings_Declaration_Villarejo_1989.pdf>Link to Full Text</a></p>

Self-reported information provided by 180 representative labor contacttors during interviews conducted in 1990 was compared with EDD records for each employer. There was a systematic difference between the two records for many of the employers who were interviewed, biased toward larger values of self-reported payrolls. Nearly all of the employers who were interviewed were licensed farm labor contractos in California, only a very few lacked the required state license.   <A HREF="Fulltext/CIRS_Collected_Papers/Agriculture_s_Underground_Economy.pdf.pdf">Link to Full Text</A></p>

Consumption of canned and other types of processing has plunged during this period. For some vegatbles, notably excluding tomatoes, a similar decrease of consumer prefernce is also apparent. Increasingly, consumers prefer value-added, fresh or fresh-cut produce, typically sold as triple-washed in relatively small bags. The rapidity of this adjustment by consumers suggests that convinence in meal preparation outwieighs the increased costs of the newer forms of distribution.   <a href=Fulltext/CIRS_Collected_Papers/Kick_the_Can_Production_and_Employment_in_the_Wesdt_Coast_Fruit_and_Vegetable_Processing_Industries.pdf.pdf>Link to Full Text</a></p>

        <p class="pub_summary">The California Agricultural Worker Health Survey (CAWHS) is a statewide health study of 971 California farm workers that was conducted by CIRS in 1999 with funding from <a href="http://www.calendow.org/">The California Endowment</a>. The survey represents the first randomized health study of farmworkers conducted in the United States. The survey encompassed: (1) levels of health care utilization by the participants' household; (2) current health status; (3) work history; (4) immigration status; (5) workplace conditions and training; (6) housing conditions; (7) wage rates and household income; and (8) occupational conditions, safety training, and injuries. Participants were also asked to participate in physical exams where baseline data on blood chemistry was collected. This landmark study brings the health crisis affecting California's farmworkers to the fore and provides the first-ever baseline health data for farmworkers in California.
