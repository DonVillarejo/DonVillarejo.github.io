    <p class="publication text-center">During 2018, Don Villarejo will be concluding his contributions to the Salinas-Pajaro Valleys Farm Worker Housing Needs Assessment, a project of the California Institute for Rural Studies and the California Coalition for Rural Housing. The project is sponsored by the City of Salinas, and includes local county and city jurisdictions as partners.
      <br><br>On May 1, he will also conclude sixty-two years of civic participation, and will no longer be available to work on new projects in any capacity, nor will he be available for participating in conferences or public speaking. Happily, he will turn his attention to long-postponed writing.</p>
