<P align=center>Statement of Don Villarejo, Ph.D.</P>
<P align=center>Executive Director, California Institute for Rural Studies, 
Inc.</P>
<P>The Central Valley Project Improvement Act (CVPIA), the primary focus of 
today's hearing is but one piece of a much larger policy shift regarding 
irrigated agriculture in the West. Environmental concerns, once not even 
seriously considered, are now at least as important a concern of Federal and 
State policy as are supplying water to agricultural and urban users.</P>
<P>However, virtually all discussion of water policy in California appears to be 
predicated on reducing water supplies to agriculture. Whether it is the 
allocation of 800,000 acre-ft per year to environmental restoration, or opening 
the door to large-scale water transfers to moneyed urban interests, agriculture 
will lose significant supplies. Most recently, Bulletin 160-98 of the California 
Department of Water Resources, titled <EM>The California Water Plan Update</EM> 
(January 1998), discusses the projected growth of urban and environmental water 
use in California to the Year 2020. Urban use will increase by 37% and 
environmental use will increase by 26%. Agriculture's use is projected to 
experience a net decline of 2.3 million acre-ft per year by 2020.</P>
<P>At present levels of water use, these immense reductions of irrigation 
supplies are equivalent to taking hundreds of thousands of acres of land out of 
production. California stands to lose more farm land as a result of 
environmental policy than to all of the effects of conversion of farm land due 
to urbanization.</P>
<P>But the requirements of CVPIA and the projected decline in agricultural water 
use do not seem to be enough to satisfy environmental advocates. In a letter to 
CalFed Bay-Delta Program Executive Director Lester Snow, dated September 10, 
1997, the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) suggested that a "soft path" 
solution to Bay-Delta cleanup could be achieved if between 400,000 and 600,000 
acres of San Joaquin Valley irrigated agricultural land were permanently 
retired.</P>
<P>Completely absent from these discussions are the human impacts of taking 
hundreds of thousands of agricultural land out of production. Tens of thousands 
of farm jobs are at stake here, dozens of communities stand to lose their 
economic base, resulting in the loss of hundreds of small businesses, not to 
mention the devastating impact on the local tax base. But neither the NRDC, the 
CalFed, nor the Department of Interior have conducted the necessary 
socio-economic impact studies that would be needed to determine </P>
<P>the magnitude of these harmful impacts on the lives of tens of thousands of 
hard-working Californians.</P>
<P>In 1994-95 CIRS conducted a retrospective socio-economic impact study in the 
community of Mendota, just thirty miles west of this hearing room. Our report 
was published in March 1996 and is titled <EM>93640 at Risk: Farmers, Workers 
and Townspeople in an Era of Water Uncertainty</EM>. Funding for the study was 
provided by the Community Alliance with Family Farmers, under a grant they 
received from the Ford Foundation.</P>
<P>The purpose of the study was to determine the socio-economic impacts of 
substantial reductions of irrigation supplies to an agricultural community. 
Mendota is a roughly one hundred square mile area bounded by the Postal Zip Code 
93640 and comprises about 60,000 acres of irrigated farm land. The opportunity 
to examine these effects was provided by the unfortunate six-year 1987-92 
drought that affected many farming areas of the state. Surface water supplies to 
this region were reduced by as much as 75% in the course of the drought 
period.</P>
<P>Agricultural economists and environmental advocates have long argued that 
when water supplies are reduced, or when irrigation water becomes more 
expensive, farmers will respond by switching their plantings from extensive to 
intensive crops. Thus, their predictions suggest that during the drought Mendota 
farmers would have increased their plantings of vegetables and other intensive 
crops, and would have correspondingly eliminated substantial plantings of 
extensive crops, such as wheat, alfalfa or cotton.</P>
<P>In fact, we found the opposite result. Overall, Mendota irrigated acreage 
declined by about 14% as a result of the drought. But instead of increased 
plantings of intensive crops, Mendota farmers actually <EM>reduced</EM> their 
acreage of vegetable crops by as much as 37%, in the case of melons, whereas 
field crop plantings were reduced by just 5%. This is shown in Exhibit 1 
(attached).</P>
<P>As a consequence of the tremendous decline in fresh vegetable production, 
Mendota payrolls fell by at least 14%, and three of the seven wholesale 
vegetable packing houses closed their doors and either went out of business or 
left the area.</P>
<P>Other adverse impacts in Mendota that were associated with the loss of 
irrigation water during the drought included:</P>
<P><FONT face=Symbol> </FONT>Loss of 26% of all of the farms of Mendota;</P>
<P><FONT face=Symbol> </FONT>Loss of 70% of small family farms;</P>
<P><FONT face=Symbol> </FONT>Retail sales in the community fell by 11%;</P>
<P><FONT face=Symbol> </FONT>Agricultural land values declined by about 30% 
(see Exhibit 2);</P>
<P><FONT face=Symbol> </FONT>Mendota city tax revenue declined both as a result 
of depressed business conditions and as a result of declining property 
values.</P>
<P>The prestigious National Academy of Sciences/National ResearchCouncil report 
<EM>Water Transfers in the West: Efficiency, Equity, and the Environment</EM> 
stated, "No issue gave the committee more trouble than the question of how to 
characterize and evaluate the effects of water transfers on small communities." 
Our study of the impact of reducing irrigation supplies in Mendota is the first 
attempt to do so. The results of are study are extremely disturbing.</P>
<P>In my view this committee needs to insist that proper socio-economic 
assessments be undertaken <EM>before</EM> any more water transfers, land 
retirement, or other schemes that take water from agricultural communities are 
permitted. At present, incalculable damage is occurring as the new 
environmentally-driven water ethic is being put into place.</P>
<P>In my view it is nothing short of arrogant and irresponsible for 
environmental advocacy groups to assert that policies that will take away the 
livelihood of tens of thousands of California farm workers are a "soft path" 
solution to the state's water problems. It is only soft if you don't have to 
make your living by manual labor in an agricultural field. It is time that we 
not only assessed the impact of such policies, but also put into place 
mitigation efforts to lessen the adverse effects.</P>
