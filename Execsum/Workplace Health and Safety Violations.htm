<P>Agriculture is an important industry in California, producing over $22 
billion in farm cash receipts annually. Apart from its economic benefits, 
however, national and state data show that agriculture is one of the most 
dangerous industries with respect to occupational illnesses and injuries. 
Potential hazards in the agricultural work environment include farm machinery, 
livestock, chemicals, and inhalable dusts. Unintentional injuries represent one 
of the most important occupational health problems among the agricultural 
workforce. Data from the National Safety Council for 1993 indicate a 
work-related mortality among agricultural workers of 35 deaths per 100,000 
person-years, making agriculture the most dangerous industrial sector according 
to this index, ahead of mining and construction (33 and 22 deaths, respectively, 
per 100,000 person-years).(1)</P>
<P>California's agricultural industry includes over 77,000 farms and employs 
approximately 700,000 farmworkers, more than 90% of whom are Latino. Language 
and literacy barriers may complicate safety training, increasing vulnerability 
to occupational health risks. Data from the California Workers' Compensation 
insurance system show that in 1992 California farmworkers <FONT 
face="Times New Roman">experienced</FONT> more than 35,000 on-the-job injuries, 
or 11.6 reported injuries per 100 full-time employees. In contrast, fewer than 
800 occupational injuries or deaths were experienced by California farmers and 
family members in the same year. Therefore, concern for employees is the natural 
primary focus of regulatory, enforcement, and educational efforts to improve 
occupational health on California farms.(2)</P>
<P>These efforts have received renewed importance because California's 
agricultural industry has become more dependent on hired workers in recent 
decades. Today, at least 80% of all work on California farms is performed by 
hired labor.(3) Historically California farm operators have hired farm laborers 
directly, but in recent years many have begun to use labor-market 
intermediaries, or farm-labor contractors. The increasing reliance on farm-labor 
contractors has relieved many farm operators of some of the cost and 
responsibility for the workers they need. In particular, responsibility for 
Workers' Compensation and other occupational-health and labor-force investments 
have devolved to the farm-labor contractors, although farm operators retain 
joint responsibility for assuring that Workers' Compensation coverage is 
provided.(4)</P><BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2"><BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><STRONG>ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITY AND INTERAGENCY COOPERATION</STRONG></P>
<P>Regulation of the agricultural workplace falls under the purview of several 
federal, state, and local agencies. These include the U.S. Department of Labor, 
Cal-OSHA, Department of Industrial Relations, California Department of Pesticide 
Regulation, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, county health departments, 
county agricultural commissioners, and the California Highway Patrol 
(responsible for overseeing transportation of workers to jobs). The 
fragmentation of regulatory activities causes inefficiency among regulators and 
confusion among employers and employees. In particular, lack of information 
sharing between agencies and the resulting gaps or duplication of effort lead to 
ineffective enforcement and educational efforts. Recognizing this, the 
California Labor Commission began a collaborative pilot program in 1992 that was 
designed to achieve greater efficiency through sharing of resources and 
information. With its focus on industries with a history of regulatory problems, 
the pilot program was named the Targeted Industries Partnership Program (TIPP). 
It focused first on agriculture and garment manufacturing because of their 
economic importance for California as well as their history of regulatory 
problems.</P>
<P>TIPP is jointly administered by the California Labor Commissioner's Office 
and the U.S. Department of Labor, Wage and Hour Division (USDOL-WHD). 
Participating regulatory and enforcement agencies include the California 
Department of Industrial Relations, Division of Labor Standards Enforcement 
(CDIR-DLSE), the California Employment Development Department (EDD), and 
Cal-OSHA. During any given TIPP activity, up to 12 different agencies (federal, 
state, or local) may be involved.</P>
<P>Traditionally, enforcement agencies have relied heavily on informants; their 
efforts have been largely complaint-driven. The TIPP program, in contrast, 
generally operates by conducting "sweeps" based on industry and geographic 
targeting (the selection of a locale where agencies believe they will find 
violations) rather than pursuing specific operations identified through 
complaints. The purpose of multiagency sweeps is not only to identify 
violations, but also to generate leads on other violators. These leads can then 
be immediately pursued to find other violations.</P>
<P>This coordinated approach helps to weave together what has been a haphazard 
patchwork of regulatory activity. The specific areas of enforcement addressed by 
participating TIPP agencies include health and safety, farm-labor contractor 
laws (licensing, registration, vehicle insurance), Workers' Compensation 
insurance, and regulations pertaining to wage and hour requirements and record 
keeping. However, TIPP only coordinates agency activities; the authority to 
issue notices of violation remains with the participating agencies. </P><BR 
WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2"><BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><STRONG>STUDY OBJECTIVES</STRONG></P>
<P>The TIPP program offers major benefit for both employees and employers. 
Employees have greater assurance of working in a safe work environment. Farm 
operators who are in compliance with the law also benefit: More widespread 
compliance means that they are less likely to be competing with other operators 
who are reducing their costs through noncompliance. The state as a whole stands 
to benefit in that improved compliance brings about safer working conditions, 
leading to increased productivity and reduced lost-work time, medical expenses, 
and other associated losses.</P>
<P>TIPP operations might offer even further benefit through improved targeting 
of noncompliant farm operators. The main goal of this study was to link reports 
of health-and-safety law violations to specific agricultural producers contained 
in a large database of California farm operations. The purpose of this linkage 
was to identify agricultural producers with notices of violation and <FONT 
face="Times New Roman">to compare</FONT> this group with producers who had not 
received notices of violation. Since regulatory agencies use information 
profiling high-risk operations to focus educational and enforcement programs 
where they are most needed within the agricultural sector, the results of our 
study were to serve as a basis for an improved profile of producers at increased 
risk of committing regulatory violations.</P><BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2"><BR

<P><STRONG>MATERIALS AND METHODS</STRONG> </P>
<P>The databases used for the study included the California Farm Operators 
Database developed and maintained by the California Institute of Rural Studies 
(CIRS), containing information on over 37,000 California agricultural operators, 
and the 1993 and 1994 TIPP databases, containing reports of operations receiving 
notices of violation in 1993 and 1994, respectively. A fourth database, the CDIR 
Farm Labor Contractor License File, was used to identify TIPP citation 
recipients licensed as farm-labor contractors.</P><BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><STRONG>California Farm Operators Database</STRONG></P>
<P>The California Farm Operators Database, developed and maintained by CIRS, 
holds data on 37,631agricultural operators with permits for pesticide use in the 
state. Information for each operator was the most recent available, which in 
nearly all cases ranged from 1992 to 1994. The database includes a unique 
operator identification number (CIRS identification number), the type of 
agricultural operation (e.g., farm, dairy, nursery), the number of counties the 
operator farmed in, a list of the reported counties and year for which crop and 
acreage information are provided, and acreage for each crop farmed.</P><BR 
WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><STRONG>TIPP 1993 and 1994 Databases</STRONG> </P>
<P>The TIPP 1993 and 1994 databases contain records of notices of violation for 
health-and-safety and labor-law infractions in agricultural operations. This 
information was collected differently for 1993 and 1994. The 1993 TIPP reports 
included report number, name of business, type of business, date of report, and 
34 violation categories. Each report could contain more than one violation, and 
an agricultural operation could receive more than one report during the 
year.</P>
<P>For 1994, the TIPP data form added a violation code and description as well 
as a comments field and did not use the same violation categories employed in 
the 1993 TIPP database. For comparability in our analysis, we categorized the 
violation codes and descriptions for 1994 in a format similar to that of the 
1993 TIPP reports. During 1994 the TIPP program ceased collecting information 
separately on health-and-safety violations. Instead, for 1994 and subsequent 
years <FONT face="Times New Roman">health-and-safety</FONT> violations were 
recorded separately by Cal-OSHA using the federal Occupational Safety and Health 
Administration's IMIS system. Thus, there were only seven health-and-safety 
violations recorded in 1994, versus 124 in 1993.</P><BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><STRONG>CDIR Farm Labor Contractor License File</STRONG> </P>
<P>The Farm Labor Contractor License File was provided to CIRS by the CDIR 
License branch. It represents a compilation of all farm-labor contractors 
holding a license at any time in the previous six years (1990-1995). The file 
contained 2,600 entries, including 1,050 active license holders for 1995.</P><BR

<P><STRONG>MAJOR FINDINGS</STRONG></P>
<P>The interdatabase linkage enabled us to identify operations within the 
California Farm Operators Database that had been cited and to compare them with 
those that had not.(5) Our study of notices of violation identified by TIPP 
during 1993 and 1994 resulted in the following major findings. </P>
<P><STRONG>The TIPP databases yielded 323 reports for 1993 and 278 for 
1994.</STRONG> The 601 reports comprised 1,525 notices of violation.</P>
<P><STRONG>Farm operations represented the largest share of reports.</STRONG> Of 
the 601 TIPP reports for 1993 and 1994, 261 (43%) involved farm operators. 
Farm-labor contractors represented 161 (27%) of the reports. The remaining 30% 
of reports involved raiteros (persons providing transportation to work sites), 
shippers, and others. For 1993, 69% (223/323) of reports involved multiple 
notices of violation, compared with only 19% (53/278) for 1994. However, 
participating agencies keep separate records of their enforcement actions. In 
particular, health-and-safety violations identified by Cal-OSHA were no longer 
included in the TIPP database after 1993. As a result, there does not exist a 
single set of records reflecting TIPP activities.</P>
<P><STRONG>Health-and-safety violations constituted a minority of 
violations.</STRONG> Of the 1,525 notices of violation contained in TIPP reports 
for 1993 and 1994, 131 (9%) involved health-and-safety infractions. The most 
common of these were inadequate washing facilities, cited in 70 (53%) notices of 
violation.</P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman"><STRONG>Larger farm operations and those 
operating in more than one county were more likely to be cited.</STRONG></FONT> 
One hundred sixty-nine TIPP reports comprising 520 notices of violation were 
matched with operations within the California Farm Operators Database. These 
operations had greater acreage than operations not receiving notices of 
violation (mean 8,676 vs. 7,424 acres, p&lt;0.01). Cited operations were also 
more likely than noncited operations to operate in more than one county (17% vs. 
4%, p&lt;0.001). The most common crops among cited operations were strawberries 
(28% of operations), raisin grapes (17% of operations), and broccoli (17% of 
operations). These three crops were also more likely to be grown by cited than 
by noncited operations.</P>
<P><STRONG>Operations cited for more than one infraction (112 operations) were 
more likely than those cited for a single infraction (57 operations) to farm in 
more than one county (19% vs. 12%, p&lt;0.3).</STRONG> This finding was not 
statistically significant.</P>
<P><STRONG>Several types of operation were at increased risk for TIPP 
citation.</STRONG> Relative to labor expenses, operations with the following 
characteristics were more likely than others to receive TIPP citations: fruit 
and nut operations (for which the excess was most marked among berry producers), 
small operations with annual farm cash receipts of <FONT 
face="Times New Roman">less than $100,000</FONT>, and operations in the Southern 
California coast region. </P>
<P><STRONG>Farm-labor contractors appear to be at increased risk for TIPP 
citation compared to farm operators.</STRONG> Based on Cal-OSHA files and state 
licensing files, approximately one in 14 licensed farm-labor contractors 
received a fine for serious OSHA violations on an average annual basis. Farm 
operators had a much lower average annual rate, approximately one in 400.</P><BR 
WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2"><BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><STRONG>EPIDEMIOLOGIC ADVANCES AND LIMITATIONS </STRONG></P>
<P>This project represents the first attempt to examine data from the TIPP 
program from an epidemiologic perspective -- that is, to seek associations 
between the characteristics of California's farm operations and the distribution 
of <FONT face="Times New Roman">agricultural</FONT> regulatory infractions. We 
were successful in characterizing and summarizing the TIPP violations, within 
the constraints of the data available. However, we had only limited success in 
developing a profile of high-risk operations that could distinguish them from 
operations that had not received notices of violation. The limitations are 
imposed by the character of the databases, which contained limited information 
on variables of major epidemiologic interest, such as operator characteristics 
(e.g., age, gender, ethnicity, education, duration of work in farming) and farm 
characteristics.</P>
<P>Because the TIPP records are separate from those maintained by Cal-OSHA in 
the IMIS system, and because Cal-OSHA citations are not recorded in the TIPP 
database, the distribution of violations noted by the two systems may be 
different. For example, Cal-OSHA records indicate that the most commonly cited 
violation in agriculture for 1993 and 1994 was the failure to establish and 
maintain a written Illness and Injury Prevention Plan, whereas TIPP data showed 
that the most common violation was failure to provide washing facilities.</P>
<P>The finding of larger acreage among cited farm operations may have several 
explanations. Larger operations may be more likely to have violations, either 
because of an inherently more hazardous environment, or because they encompass 
more workers and hazardous conditions simply as a result of their size. However, 
this finding could also represent the results of selection bias if larger 
operations are more likely to be inspected. </P>
<P>Larger farm operations were at greater risk for receiving notices of 
violation, but relative to labor expense smaller operations had an increased 
likelihood of citation. While at first glance these findings may appear in 
conflict, in fact they are not. Although smaller operations were at lower 
average risk of citation than the larger ones, they use much less labor, and 
hence the number of citations relative to the number of workers they hire is 
greater. Thus, from the farm owner's or manager's standpoint, larger operations 
are at greater risk for notices of violation from a TIPP agency. From the 
individual worker's standpoint, however, working on smaller operations puts him 
or her at greater risk of working under citable conditions.</P>
<P>We also found that operations receiving notices of violation were about four 
times as likely to have farms in more than one county than were noncited 
operations. Similarly, operations with multiple violations were approximately 
50% more likely to have farms in more than one county than were operations with 
a single violation.</P>
<P>There were several aspects of the TIPP program and resultant data that limit 
their usefulness for epidemiologic purposes. The first involves the sampling 
procedure. Ideally, one would have a valid list of all California agricultural 
operations utilizing hired farm labor, from which a random sample of farms could 
be selected for inspection. From this sample one could obtain valid estimates 
for the frequency of workplace violations and the characteristics of operations 
at which they are found. Presently, a universal listing of California farm 
operations does not exist. We used the California Farm Operators Database 
developed and maintained by CIRS. This database is not a comprehensive listing 
of all farm operators in California, and it is likely that smaller operations 
are underrepresented in the CIRS database. National data suggest that smaller 
farms have higher injury rates.(6) However, larger farms are more likely to 
employ farmworkers. Thus the likely effect of the selection against smaller 
operations is unclear.</P>
<P>Although the lack of a universal listing of agricultural operations does not 
present insurmountable difficulties, for epidemiologic purposes the nonrandom 
nature of the sampling process does present significant problems. Whether or not 
a farm operation is targeted for inspection may be influenced by its past 
practices, location, size of workforce, and other factors. The end result is 
that the study sample of operations with citations may not be representative of 
all farms with violations, and the study sample of operations without citations 
may not be representative of all farms without violations. The likely result of 
this is to obscure real differences that may exist and interfere with our 
ability to detect them.</P>
<P>In addition, the California Farm Operators Database data were from the most 
recent year available, i.e., not necessarily from 1993 and 1994, the two years 
of TIPP data. There were also several limitations to the data on acreage 
reported by agricultural operators. In some cases the operator did not report 
acreage, but only that the crop was grown. For these cases, no comparisons on 
acreage could be made. Operators could also report several different crops that 
would be grown over the course of the year. In some instances the operator may 
have reported total farm acreage for each crop, thereby exaggerating the acreage 
under cultivation and limiting the accuracy of total farm acreage reported by 
any operator.</P>
<P>Limitations also exist for the TIPP data, with regard to the information 
collected and the manner in which it was collected and stored. For example, the 
TIPP report forms did not include adequate identifying information or 
descriptive characteristics of the operation (e.g., crop, acreage, current 
number of employees). TIPP developed a data collection form in 1993 that 
facilitated information gathering, and we recommend that the next version seek 
expanded identifying information and descriptive characteristics. To facilitate 
data management and analysis, these forms could be put in a format suitable for 
reading by optical mark readers.</P>
<P>We recognize that the choice of information to be collected must reflect 
primarily regulatory rather than epidemiologic considerations. Nevertheless, we 
feel that the regulatory mission <FONT face="Times New Roman">would be 
aided</FONT> by having more specific information and having it collected and 
stored in a manner that facilitates epidemiologic analysis.</P><BR WP="BR1"><BR 
WP="BR2"><BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman"><STRONG>RECOMMENDATIONS</STRONG></FONT></P>
<P><STRONG></STRONG>Based on our results and experience with these data, 
and<STRONG> </STRONG>in the interest of improving farmworker protection, the 
education of farm employers and employees, and interagency cooperation and 
efficiency in an era of diminishing governmental resources, we offer the 
following recommendations for consideration to policy makers and 
regulatory/enforcement agencies.</P>
<P><STRONG><EM>The State Labor Commissioner and U.S. Department of Labor should 
expand and encourage wider adoption of the TIPP model of interagency 
collaboration. </EM></STRONG>The TIPP model has demonstrated its effectiveness 
in the large percentage of TIPP reports that include multiple citations from 
different agencies. However, there are areas in which collaboration is 
incomplete. For example, the database of TIPP reports for 1994 and subsequent 
years does not include health-and-safety violations, which are reported to the 
Cal-OSHA IMIS database.</P>
<P>The TIPP program should make a concerted effort to engage all agencies with 
regulatory responsibility in this effort. For example, the California Highway 
Patrol should be involved to address vehicular safety concerns, such as those 
related to transportation of field workers to and from work.</P>
<P>Increased interagency collaboration is helpful in maximizing the utility of 
existing resources. However, the program and the agricultural community would 
benefit by increases in resources devoted to preventive education and field 
enforcement activities. The program's credibility and effectiveness would be 
advanced by assuring that participating staff have both linguistic and cultural 
fluency and an understanding of the local agricultural employment systems.</P>
<P><EM><STRONG>Improved data collection procedures would facilitate data 
management and computer analysis in a timely fashion appropriate to the needs of 
participating agencies.</EM></STRONG><STRONG></STRONG> Data collection forms can 
be designed to facilitate data collection and accurate entry into computer 
systems for analysis. Design should include appropriate categories of 
violations. This process should be guided by considerations of how the data will 
be used. In particular, whether categories are broad and inclusive rather than 
narrow and precise will depend on how the data will be used from a regulatory 
standpoint. If it is important to discern between different types of violations, 
then a greater number of narrower categories will be required. Data forms can be 
prepared in an optically readable format. These forms have a major advantage in 
that the completed form can simply be fed into a device that automatically reads 
the data and enters them into a computer for analysis. This process can save a 
significant amount of time, reduce data errors, and facilitate analysis and 
report writing.</P>
<P>Laptop computers for on-site data entry would also improve program 
efficiency. Laptops could also be used to hold databases, such as insurance 
records or histories of violation, that would be useful in the field. More 
generally, improved utilization of computers would allow more timely review of 
data and facilitate planning of agency activities. For example, data we analyzed 
for this report showed a high level of violations among berry producers. 
However, more recent information, conveyed to us in personal communications by 
Department of Industrial Relations personnel, suggests that current compliance 
among strawberry producers is high. Improved use of computers with short 
turnaround time for data review would enable agencies to react to changes as 
they occur.</P>
<P>The utility of reports on which citations are based could be greatly 
increased by including further descriptive information relevant for the 
participating agencies. In the IMIS system utilized by Cal-OSHA, for example, 
information on an operation's number of employees and their union status is 
included. Expanded descriptive information deemed relevant by the participating 
agencies would aid in understanding patterns of violation.</P>
<P><STRONG><EM>TIPP should develop standardized reports showing inspection 
activity.</EM></STRONG> Basic reports documenting prevalence and characteristics 
of specified infractions could be developed and to a large extent automated by 
computer. Although in-depth analyses may be required <FONT 
face="Times New Roman">subsequently</FONT>, the basic descriptive report could 
be developed relatively easily. In addition, if a computer-readable report form 
is developed, real-time data and reports could be available with little demand 
for administrative staff time devoted to their preparation. Rather, valuable 
staff time could be devoted to interpreting and developing policy, preventive, 
and educational measures. The descriptive reports should be designed to meet the 
needs of the relevant agency. Customized versions of the report could then be 
developed to meet the needs of the other participating agencies.</P>
<P><STRONG><EM>TIPP should regularize follow-up of cited operations to assure 
subsequent compliance and determine the impact of enforcement actions. 
</EM></STRONG>Follow-up for cited operations is an important part of maintaining 
subsequent compliance with regulatory requirements. Clearly, maintaining staff 
for this purpose represents a budgetary and personnel demand for agencies that 
may have insufficient resources. However, collaboration with partnered agencies 
offers potential efficiencies that may allow increased follow-up 
inspections.</P>
<P><STRONG><EM>TIPP should consider developing a program to provide 
statistically unbiased information on the prevalence of infractions, based on a 
representative sample of local operations employing farmworkers either directly 
or through contractors.</EM></STRONG> An inspection program utilizing an 
unbiased (i.e., representative) sample of local operations employing farmworkers 
directly or through contractors would enable agencies to determine how 
frequently specific infractions occur. This would provide a truer picture of 
infractions among operations and allow agencies to develop educational and 
enforcement strategies based on a more realistic view of infractions within the 
industry.</P>
<P>In contrast, when information is based on complaints, the resulting data 
represent only a group of agricultural operations for which complaints have been 
lodged; such a group is a biased sample -- i.e., it is not representative of all 
agricultural operations. Similarly, operations that have not generated 
complaints may still have infractions of health-and-safety laws that have simply 
not been reported. Information on the true prevalence of specific infractions 
would be invaluable for developing policy and focusing resources, and 
information on true prevalence can only be obtained from a valid sampling 
system.</P>
<P>A valid, unbiased sampling system ideally would involve random sample 
selection from a complete list of operations in a given <FONT 
face="Times New Roman">area</FONT>. Although various state agencies maintain 
lists of agricultural operations for their purposes (e.g., tax collection, crop 
production), the state does not maintain a comprehensive listing of operations 
utilizing farm labor. Developing and maintaining such a list requires ongoing 
commitment of resources. The California Farm Operator Database, maintained by 
CIRS and developed from several existing databases, appears to be the most 
comprehensive available.</P>
<P>A program to provide information on the prevalence of infractions would 
represent a departure from the original purpose of the TIPP program. 
Specifically, such a program would entail inspection of a random sample of 
operations, rather than focusing on those with complaints or at high risk for 
infractions. Whereas the original TIPP model garners support among employers 
because it lessens unfair competition from operators who reduce their costs 
through noncompliance, a random-inspection program intended to provide unbiased 
information on the prevalence of infractions may encounter difficulty in gaining 
support from employers.</P>
<P><STRONG><EM>TIPP should target groups at increased risk for violation with 
educational programs to help them understand the law, resources for maintaining 
compliance, and enforcement efforts.</EM></STRONG> Based on the data we 
examined, this group includes farm-labor contractors, larger operations, and 
farm owners operating in more than one county. Fruit- and nut-producing 
operations appear to be at higher risk than others. We caution, however, that 
identification of specific high-risk groups is subject to error because the data 
were not from a randomly selected, representative sample of agricultural 
operations. In addition, they represent the time frame 1993-1994.</P><BR
