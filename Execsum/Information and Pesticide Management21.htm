<P>This report summarizes findings of a study designed to test the efficacy of a 
voluntary pesticide reduction program in California almonds and walnuts. We 
compared two groups of tree nut growers. First, a group of growers who are 
members of the Biologically Integrated Orchard Systems (BIOS) program sponsored 
by the Community Alliance with Family Farmers (CAFF); and second, a group of 
growers of the same crop who were carefully selected to serve as a cohort to the 
first group. The matching procedure involved identifying a producer who farms a 
nut orchard located within the same section of land as the BIOS grower (a 
section of land has an area of one square mile and contains 640 acres), and 
whose orchard is comparable in size to the BIOS farmer. In addition, an effort 
was made to match the BIOS farmer with a cohort grower who operates the same 
total number of nut crop acres. </P>
<P>We attempted to determine if there was a significant difference between the 
two groups from the point of view of the pest related inputs such as information 
sources and uses, including technical advice, their use of in-orchard traps and 
attractants, chemical and biological inputs, and cultural practises. We also 
collected data on crop yields and processor rejection rates due to insect 
damage. </P>
<P>A total of thirty-six almond growers, all in Merced and Stanislaus Counties, 
were contacted and interviewed in person during the summer 1997. Of this toital, 
twenty-three growers were participants in the CAFF/BIOS program and thirteen 
were Traditional producers. The sample of walnut growers was drawn from Solano 
and Yolo Counties. Five were participants in the CAFF/BIOS program and sixteen 
were Traditional growers. </P>
<P>Survey results demonstrate that members of the voluntary pesticide use 
reduction program, BIOS, as well as the Traditional growers in the sample, 
invested significant resources in obtaining information about orchard pests, as 
well as about chrmical and non-chemical methods of controlling these pests, in 
an attempt to maximize farm income. In the use of pheromone and Navel Orange 
worm trapping, members of the BIOS project were much more aggressive than the 
Traditional growers in investing in these traps as a method of monitoring pest 
populations in their orchards. </P>
<P>Although a large majority of both Traditional and BIOS projects members 
followed the recommended practice of removing mummies from almonds, the 
proportion of BIOS growers putting in a cover crop was almost triple that of the 
Traditional growers. </P>
<P>Traditional growers reported higher pest control costs than their cohort BIOS 
members. On the other hand, Traditional growers reported higher average yields 
than did the BIOS participants. Traditional growers reported lower rejection 
rates by processors than was the case for the BIOS participants. Data from the 
survey indicate the average almond yield for BIOS growers was 1,275 pounds per 
acre, while the Traditional group averaged 1,520 pounds per acre. Secondly, the 
processor rejection rate for almonds averaged 2.15 percent for BIOS growers and 
1.21 percent for the Traditional group. The comparable rejection rate for 
walnuts was 3.9 percent for Traditional and 5.2 percent for BIOS growers. </P>
<P>When Pesticide Use Reports (PURs) for these growers were tabulated, both 
groups exhibited a marked decreased use of restricted pesticides each year since 
1993, as measured by pounds of active ingredients per acre treated. In addition, 
BIOS orchards showed significantly lower levels of all types of pesticide use as 
compared with cohort orchards. While BIOS participants reported lower use of 
pesticides, they also reported a much greater use of insect and pheromoine traps 
to monitor pest populations. Traditional growers were much more dependent on 
chemical company representatives for their major source of information. </P>
<P>Several conclusions can be drawn from this study. First, information is the 
least expensive, least polluting and least hazardous input to farming. Second, 
both thise almond and walnut growers who have joined a biological/cultural pest 
mangement project and those who have not have reduced their dependency on 
resticted pesticides in recent years. The survey results also indicate that 
dissemination of information about these practices is likel occuring through 
informal, neighbor-to-neighbor networks that exist in every community. Finally, 
since this experiment has been of a relatively short duration, the lower yields 
and higher rejection rates of the BIOS growers should be interpreted cautiously. 
The question of long term economic sustainability is yet to be answered. </P>
