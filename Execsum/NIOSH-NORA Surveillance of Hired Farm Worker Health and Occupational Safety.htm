<H1>New Directions in the Surveillance of Hired Farm Worker Health and

<P><BIG>A Report of the Work Group Convened by NIOSH, May 5, 1995, to Identify 
Priorities for Hired Farm Worker Occupational Health Surveillance and 
Research</BIG></P>

<H2 class=left>Foreword</H2>
<P>There are approximately 2.5 million people who perform hired agricultural 
work in the United States. These workers face numerous hardships in the course 
of their normal work day, in addition to the added stress they face as a result 
of the seasonal nature of their work. According to data from the National Census 
of Fatal Occupational Injuries surveillance system, the agricultural industry 
has the second highest rate of occupational fatalities in the United States. 
Although poor working conditions for hired farm workers have been a persistent 
problem in the United States, they have not received sufficient attention. In 
1990, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), with a 
congressional mandate, began an agricultural safety and health initiative. As 
part of this initiative, NIOSH convened a work group in May 1995 consisting of 
experts in the areas of public policy, farm worker health, and occupational 
health, to assist in developing a prioritized set of objectives for the 
surveillance of hired farm worker occupational safety and health. In addition to 
the original meeting, work group members consulted with one another over the 
course of a year to finalize the priorities.</P>
<P><EM>New Directions in the Surveillance of Hired Farm Worker Health and 
Occupational Safety</EM> is the report to NIOSH from that work group. In 
addition to priorities for surveillance and research of the occupational safety 
and health of hired farm workers, this comprehensive report outlines the factors 
that determine the occupational health status of hired farm workers. It also 
suggests recommendations for overcoming barriers involved in research with this 
population.</P>
<P>In 1996, NIOSH and its partners developed the National Occupational Research 
Agenda (NORA) in an effort to address changes in the U.S. workplace as well as 
the increasingly diversified U.S. work force. NORA consists of 21 priorities 
areas for occupational health research, many of which are relevant to this 
population and the priorities outlined in this report, including: Special 
Populations at Risk, Surveillance Research Methods, Allergic and Irritant 
Dermatitis, Musculoskeletal Disorders, Asthma and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary 
Disease, Control Technology and Personal Protective Equipment, Infectious 
Diseases, and Traumatic Injuries. Farm workers provide a good example of a 
population of non-English speaking, low-literacy immigrant workers who migrate 
between a series of temporary jobs. This report provides recommendations and 
highlights the complex issues involved in studying these immigrant workers.</P>
<P>This document, as a consensus of experts from around the United States, will 
be a valuable resource on the occupational safety and health needs of farm 
workers.</P>
