Summary</B></FONT><B><O:P> </O:P></B></SPAN></H1>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-ansi-language: EN-US"><FONT 
face=Arial>California’s share of national crop production has been increasing 
over the past twenty years.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>This 
trend reflects a crop mix in the state that is now one-third field crops and two 
thirds vegetable, fruit, nut and nursery products.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>By contrast, U.S. crop production is two 
thirds field crops and one third in the other crops.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Clearly, California’s agriculture is now 
dominated by labor-intensive crops.&nbsp;<O:P> </O:P></FONT></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-ansi-language: EN-US"><FONT face=Arial>In 
the period 1969-1987 California vegetable production (weight measure) increased 
by 78% grape production increased by 33% and tree fruit production increased by 
9%.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Nursery product output shows 
much greater increased in this same period but the changes can only be measure 
by farm market value. Not by physical volume.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Crops showing especially large increases 
in production include broccoli, cantaloupes, wine grapes and 
strawberries.&nbsp;<O:P> </O:P></FONT></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-ansi-language: EN-US"><FONT 
face=Arial>Consideration of labor needs for crop production shows that the crops 
with the greatest overall labor demand are, in order grapes (all varieties), 
citrus, lettuce, strawberries, broccoli, cantaloupes, fresh tomatoes, Freestone 
peaches, avocados, carrots, canning tomatoes and cauliflower.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Measures of overall labor demand are not 
available for nursery products or livestock products (dairy, poultry and 
eggs).&nbsp;<O:P> </O:P></FONT></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-ansi-language: EN-US"><FONT 
face=Arial>Direct employment of hired farm workers by farm operators in 
California declined throughout the 1980’s, whether measured by total wages paid 
or annual average monthly employment (jobs).<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Strong increases in employment by farm 
labor contractors occurred in the same period.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>It is shown that at least 40% of all 
wages paid for farm work in California today are paid by non-farm 
employers.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>This group of employers 
includes farm labor contractors, farm management companies, fresh fruit packing 
houses, and produce dealer-handlers.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
</SPAN>It is suggested that this pattern of increased reliance on labor market 
intermediaries is a response to labor market factors.&nbsp;<O:P> 
</O:P></FONT></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-ansi-language: EN-US"><FONT face=Arial>It is 
shown that the Census of Agriculture fails to adequately account for either 
wages or employment. Data for 1982 demonstrate that wages paid in California 
agriculture are at least 70% larger than reported to the Census.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>The most important reason for this 
discrepancy is that the Census collects data only from farm operators and not 
from non-farm employers.&nbsp;<O:P> </O:P></FONT></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-ansi-language: EN-US"><FONT face=Arial>Wage 
data reported by type of work activity on California farms in 1982 show that the 
share of all wages by type of crop is as follows: truck crops (vegetables), 24%; 
vineyards, 16%; orchards, 14%; horticultural crops, 11%.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>The remaining 34% of wages paid are 
distributed over a range of commodities. &nbsp;<O:P> </O:P></FONT></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-ansi-language: EN-US"><FONT face=Arial>Wage 
data for agricultural work are reported by all types of employers in connection 
with Workers Compensation Insurance and can be analyzed by size of employer 
payroll.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>During 1982 about $2.86 
billion in wages for farm work were reported by 31,815 employers.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>The biggest 1,031 employers, each paying 
more than $500,000 in wages, account for just 3.2% of all agricultural wages 
paid in 1982.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>The biggest 2,506 
employers (7.9% of the total) paid 69.2% of all agricultural wages.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>This remarkable degree of concentration 
among California agricultural employers is shown to be characteristics of nearly 
all crop industries.</FONT></SPAN></P>
