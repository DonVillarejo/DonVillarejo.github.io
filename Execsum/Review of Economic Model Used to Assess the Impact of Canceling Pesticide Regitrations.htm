<P>Pesticides have contributed significantly to food production world-wide. Yet 
in the past ten years, severe restrictions have been placed on their use in the 
United States. Indeed, some pesticides have been removed entirely from the 
market. Injuries to agricultural workers and to the environment have been the 
main factors stimulating this new governmental intervention. </P>
<P>Cancellation of a pesticide's registration impacts many different groups. 
Producers, consumers and manufacturers can be direct or indirect losers and 
gainers, while agricultural workers and the ecosystem have been direct 
beneficiaries. </P>
<P>Although there are alternatives to registration cancellation, all of them may 
impose increased costs or administrative restrictions. The effects of third 
party pesticide illness or injury are reflected as additional costs that reduce 
the net income of agricultural producers who apply a pesticide which causes 
injury to innocent parties. </P>
<P>Transaction costs, the cost of searching for information, bargaining and 
contract enforcement are very high in the case of pesticide injury compensation. 
This reflects the fact that pesticides are public goods once they have been 
applied. The costs of their adverse impacts on the environment, consumers or 
workers are usually borne by the public at large as opposed to chemical 
manufacturers or agricultural producers. </P>
<P>Existing economic models that describe the costs of canceling the 
registration of a particular pesticide can be divided into two groups. A model 
utilizing a partial budget analysis provides only limited information to policy 
makers. This is because such a model measures only changes in a commodity price 
that result from imputed reductions in market supply which are, in turn, 
attributed to decreases in product supply that result from eliminating use of a 
pesticide. The partial budget model ignores possible adjustments of supply and 
demand which could be made by both producers and consumers as both supplies and 
prices of farm commodities change with cancellation. </P>
<P>Partial equilibrium models provide some of this missing information but may 
overstate the impact of cancellation by not fully taking into account 
information about the impact of crop alternatives for growers and alternative 
substitute foods for consumers. For example, consumers may readily substitute a 
less expensive product when they perceive that the price of a preferred product 
has become too high, thus limiting price increases induced by crop shortages. 
</P>
<P>Several studies conducted on behalf of the California Environmental 
Protection Agency (Cal-EPA) have relied on these same economic models to 
determine the imputed impacts of cancellation of other important agricultural 
chemicals, such as methyl bromide. Thus, the same incomplete economic models 
continue to be relied upon to inform policy decisions. </P>
<P>A sector equilibrium model is suggested to more adequately deal with the 
above deficiencies. However, this model should also take into account the 
distortions caused by the simplifying assumptions underlying less comprehensive 
models. This would include tendencies of price to vary less than otherwise 
assumed due to market structure (size concentration among producers, or 
oligopoly), economies of scale, interdependence of producing regions, vertical 
integration and coordination and the coarseness of publicly available data. </P>
<P>The predictions of published economic models in the context of cancellation 
of a specific pesticide are examined in detail in this paper. It is our purpose 
to carefully examine both the predictions of the economic models in this 
specific case and, as well, to analyze the general validity of the models. </P>
<P>Ethyl parathion was canceled in late 1991 and, at that time, reports were 
published describing imputed crop yield losses, increases in producer costs and 
others economic effects that were predicted to result from the removal of this 
chemical from the marketplace. Adequate information is now available to examine 
the validity of these predictions. </P>
<P>A review of the economic models used in the cancellation decision for ethyl 
parathion in California resulted in the following findings: 
<UL>
  <P>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Total annual parathion use in California was decreasing 
  slightly before cancellation. </P>
  <P>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An ex post analysis of statewide acreage, yields and 
  production of almonds, plums and prunes found no significant difference in 
  these variables before and after cancellation. </P>
  <P>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In reviewing the lettuce study conducted for U.S. EPA, 
  statistically we found, using field level data, no difference between yields 
  before and after cancellation even though a 25 percent yield decrease was 
  predicted for 50 percent of lettuce acreage along the Central Coast of 
  California in the EPA study. </P>
  <P>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;California Department of Pesticide Regulation published 
  reports significantly overstate, by some 64%, the actual acreage of lettuce 
  treated with ethyl parathion in 1990. However, the total amount of the 
  chemical applied to lettuce in 1990 appears to be accurate. </P>
  <P>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subjective estimates of yield losses, even by experts, 
  are not an adequate substitute for empirical data based on rigorous field 
  tests. </P>
  <P>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A literature review found a wide range of demand and 
  supply elasticities for lettuce, both on an annual and a seasonal basis. This 
  response of price to changes in supply is important because the amount of the 
  increase of lettuce price when the supply is reduced has a strong influence on 
  who would gain and who would lose due to a cancellation. </P>
  <P>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The greater the number of production alternatives 
  available to agricultural producers, the lesser the loss in farm income due to 
  a cancellation. The greater the number of close food substitutes, the lesser 
  the loss in consumer welfare. </P>
  <P>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;California agricultural workers apparently incurred a 
  lower pesticide acute illness rate per 1,000 applications after 1986, when 
  stringent controls were placed on the use of ~parathion. This suggests that 
  administrative regulations were relatively effective. </P>
  <P>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ignoring the pesticide illnesses that go unreported 
  will bias any pesticide policy towards the status quo. </P>
  <P>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Valuing worker illness and environmental damage and 
  including these injuries within a sector equilibrium model would directly show 
  changes in their welfare status (full social accounting), and reduce the bias 
  towards the status quo found in less comprehensive models. </P>
  <P>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accuracy and credibility of assessment models can be 
  improved by taking advantage of the rapidly decreasing cost of computations, 
  thus utilizing finer data to better simulate real world behavior. </P>
  <P>Overall, this review finds that published economic models used in assessing 
  the impacts of the cancellation of ethyl parathion tended to significantly 
  <I>overstate adverse impacts</I> agricultural producers and consumers. They 
  also <I>completely ignore adverse</I> negative impacts on agricultural workers 
  and the environment. It is suggested that improvements in the models are 
  needed before they can be regarded as reliable information in the public 
  policy decision-making process. </P>
