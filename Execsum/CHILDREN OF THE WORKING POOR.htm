<H2>EXPANSION OF HEALTH CARE TO THE WORKING POOR </H2>

<H3>Lessons from Other States on Increasing Coverage</H3>

<P>More than 7 million Californians are without health insurance, and the 
numbers of the uninsured have been growing during the 1990s. Most of the 
uninsured are workers and their families. The uninsurance rate among low-income 
workers is striking: 50% of adult workers in low-income families are uninsured, 
and 60% of low-income workers in small businesses. </P>
<P>The consequences of being uninsured can be devastating, both to health and to 
family finances. Large numbers of uninsured people also strain safety-net 
providers in an increasingly competitive health care system.</P>
<P>So many Californians are uninsured for four basic reasons:</P>
<P></P>
<P></P>
<P></P>
<P></P>
<UL>
  <LI>the high cost of insurance relative to these workers' incomes; </LI></UL>
<P></P>
<P></P>
<P></P>
<P></P>
<UL>
  <LI>the lack of public subsidies for many people who can't afford insurance; 
  </LI></UL>
<P></P>
<P></P>
<P></P>
<P></P>
<UL>
  <LI>the stigma of public subsidy; and </LI></UL>
<P></P>
<P></P>
<P></P>
<P></P>
<UL>
  <LI>the complex rules and the Byzantine and often demeaning process for 
  determining eligibility. </LI></UL>
<P>A number of states have acted to increase health coverage among low-income 
workers and their families and offer lessons for California. The efforts of 
Washington, Minnesota, Hawaii, Tennessee, Oregon, Massachusetts, and Rhode 
Island suggest varied strategies to expand coverage to people not traditionally 
covered by Medicaid. In the states with established programs, 10%-20% of the 
working-age low-income population have been enrolled.</P>
<P>A number of state programs appear to have been successful in reducing the 
proportion of the low-income population that is uninsured. In some states, 
public subsidy may also lead to reduced numbers of privately insured people, 
although several have devised approaches that aim to minimize this "crowd-out" 
effect. Because California has very low rates of employer-supported coverage for 
low-income workers, there is relatively little private coverage that public 
subsidy could crowd out.</P>
<P>To reduce the number of uninsured Californians, the state should move forward 
on two fronts: </P>
<P></P>
<P></P>
<OL>
  <LI>Immediately evaluate options to expand insurance subsidies to low-income 
  workers. Federal funds offer a relatively low-cost opportunity to support such 
  expansions, including expansion of eligibility for Medi-Cal and more flexible 
  use of Healthy Families funds. <BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
  <LI>The Department of Health Services (DHS) should mount a major effort to 
  increase enrollment in Medi-Cal and Healthy Families among people who are 
  currently eligible. </LI></OL>
<P>Increasing enrollment among those eligible for publicly subsidized insurance 
should be a high priority for the legislature and the administration. There is 
great potential for increasing enrollment among Medicaid-eligible children whose 
families do not receive cash assistance, because only 60% are currently 
enrolled.</P>
<P>The DHS should forge close connections with schools to help enroll eligible 
children. Both the department and county welfare offices should be evaluated on 
the success of their enrollment efforts. Attention should be focused on this 
effort by displaying prominent public "thermometers" indicating the number of 
enrolled children. In addition, the enrollment process and eligibility systems 
should be redesigned with the goal of enabling eligible people to obtain and 
maintain health insurance coverage more easily.</P>

<H3>Opportunities to Increase Health Coverage</H3>
<P><SPAN style="COLOR: #008080"><STRONG>Lucien Wulsin, 
Jr.</STRONG></SPAN><BR><BR>Compared to most other states, California has a very 
high percentage of its population uninsured, and very low levels of enrollment 
in employment-based and individually purchased health insurance. But unlike many 
of the other states with high levels of uninsured, such as Texas or Florida, 
California has high levels of coverage through its Medi-Cal program, a broad 
array of other state programs for the uninsured, and extensive county health 
programs. California pays providers, counties, and health plans using a 
multiplicity of disconnected programs and revenue streams.</P>
<P>Most uninsured Californians lack coverage through their employers because of 
adverse affordability problems unique to low-wage workforces and the lack of an 
effective structure of purchasing coverage for the flex workforce of contract, 
temporary, part-time and seasonal employees, self-employed individuals, and 
small businesses.</P>
<P>What does California need to do to cover its working poor?</P>
<P></P>
<P></P>
<OL>
  <LI><STRONG>California needs to connect its myriad state, federal, and county 
  health programs so that eligible residents access and maintain coverage 
  seamlessly.</STRONG> Many individuals lose eligibility and become uninsured at 
  the intersections of programs, when they are bounced off of one eligibility 
  category without being enrolled in another program. A number of county 
  leaders, state officials, and health plans are making good-faith efforts to 
  extend coverage; the mind-boggling complexity of state and county financing 
  structures nearly paralyzes these efforts. These innovative efforts need a 
  more flexible and receptive response from state regulators and policymakers. 
  <BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
  <LI><STRONG>California needs to connect its state and county programs to the 
  workplace.</STRONG> Although almost all the uninsured work, very few state and 
  county programs are accessible through employment. This connection needs to be 
  done in a carefully targeted way lest it unravel existing employment-based 
  coverage. Public/private efforts to extend coverage need to be focused on 
  areas where coverage is very low--the flex workforce, very small businesses, 
  low-wage workers--and during transitions between jobs and from welfare to 
  work. <BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
  <LI><STRONG>California needs to overhaul its Medi-Cal eligibility 
  system.</STRONG> The eligibility rules are based on a now-abandoned welfare 
  system, and have become so complex as to defy common description and 
  understanding. The rules and the processes for application, verification, 
  redetermination, and termination are complex, costly to the state and 
  counties, and a major deterrent to achieving and maintaining eligibility, 
  especially for outpatient care and coverage for the working poor. California 
  should take advantage of federal opportunities to extend continuous 
  eligibility and simplify the cumbersome eligibility rules and processes. <BR 
  WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
  <LI><STRONG>State/county relationships in this area need to be improved. 
  </STRONG>Many of the state health care programs have devolved to the counties 
  and managed care plans. Some counties and managed care systems have the 
  mission and a funding base, the delivery structures, the political will, and 
  the trust of local stakeholders to make progress. County reform efforts are 
  hampered by their governance structure, balkanized and rule-laden funding 
  streams, and the culture of hospital-centered care for the indigent. Most 
  county indigent programs and Medi-Cal are heavily interdependent, yet 
  operationally autonomous. California needs to make a choice: either take over 
  and operate the health programs at the state level, or seriously assist the 
  counties that will commit to implementing reforms at the local level. </LI></OL>

<H3>Health Care Among Hired Farmworkers</H3>
<P><SPAN style="COLOR: #008080"><STRONG>Don 
Villarejo</STRONG></SPAN><BR><BR>California's 700,000 hired farmworkers, their 
families, and most of the communities in which they reside have the least access 
to health care services according to objective measures devised by the Office of 
Statewide Health Planning and Development. Careful aggregations of adjacent 
census tracts into Medical Service Study Areas (MSSAs) based on DHS data, 
combined with census information on agricultural employment, show that rural 
MSSAs with a preponderance of hired farmworkers have uniformly poorer access to 
health care services. For example, the average urban MSSA has three times as 
many primary care physicians per 1,000 residents as the average hired farmworker 
MSSA.</P>
<P>The federally defined Index of Medical Underservice (IMU) for state MSSAs 
shows that, in general, rural Californians have poorer access to health care 
services than urban residents. An MSSA with an IMU below 62.0 is eligible for 
federal designation as a Medically Underserved Area if certain other conditions 
are met. The average IMU value for California's urban MSSAs is 83.4, vs. 72.7 
for rural MSSAs. For hired farmworker MSSAs the average IMU is just 61.1, below 
the 62.0 threshold, providing direct evidence that such areas have the poorest 
access to health care services of all California communities.</P>
<P>More-affluent communities tend to attract a higher density of primary care 
physicians than do poor communities. The 10 most affluent MSSAs (all urban) have 
an average of 498 residents per primary care physician, about half the state 
average of all urban MSSAs. The 10 poorest communities (all rural) have an 
average of 3,548 residents per primary care physician--seven times the number 
for the most affluent communities and twice the average for all rural MSSAs.</P>
<P>Distinctive social and demographic characteristics of this population 
compound the difficulties of providing health care services to hired farmworkers 
and their families. Today, 95% of California's hired farmworkers are 
foreign-born (91% born in Mexico), twice the proportion of just a generation 
ago. A significant, and increasing, share are indigenous migrants from southern 
Mexico and Central America, for whom Spanish is a foreign tongue. It is 
estimated that 61% of the state's hired farmworkers live in poverty, 42% are 
unauthorized immigrants, the average educational attainment is just six years of 
school, 24% are illiterate, and another 43% are functionally illiterate.</P>
<P>There are no reports in the literature of cross-sectional studies of the 
health status of the current hired-farmworker population. However, two 
community-based studies indicate that a majority of hired farmworkers lack any 
form of health insurance, including Medi-Cal, and that some adverse health 
conditions are prevalent, among them diabetes, hypertension, and lack of a usual 
health care provider. In one study of children in the farmworker town of 
McFarland, specific unmet health services were found to be linked with 
particular aspects of demand. For example, lack of dental care was linked with 
low income, no health insurance, lack of transportation, and lack of child 
care.</P>
<P>Current federal methods of designating urban and rural areas may selectively 
disadvantage many farmworker communities. If the federal government were to 
classify communities by MSSAs instead of designating entire counties as being 
either metropolitan or nonmetropolitan, many more farmworker communities would 
be eligible for federal support.</P>

<H3>Building a System of Affordable Coverage for All Californians</H3>
<P><SPAN style="COLOR: #008080"><STRONG>E. Richard 
Brown</STRONG></SPAN><BR><BR>Job-based insurance has declined for two decades, 
leaving many adults and children without financial protection against medical 
expenses, and with little access to essential health services. Heath insurance 
is unaffordable to most of these working families, whether it is offered by 
employers or paid for individually. One in four nonelderly Californians is 
completely uninsured, more than eight out of 10 of them in families headed by a 
working adult. Seven in 10 of the uninsured have incomes below 200% of federal 
poverty guidelines.<BR><BR>We are unlikely to be able to extend coverage to the 
state's uninsured by implementing a single reform. However, by articulating a 
vision and a plan to develop a system of universal health coverage, we can begin 
implementing structural reforms incrementally. In this way, we may be able to 
overcome the political barriers to comprehensive reforms.<BR><BR>The strategy 
outlined here lays a foundation and systematically adds the elements needed to 
achieve the goal. These reforms make maximum use of federal funding, and 
integrate components into a seamless system that provides uninterrupted, 
affordable coverage for families and individuals who need it.</P>
<P></P>
<P></P>
<DL>
  <DT><STRONG>1. Fix and expand children's health insurance programs.</STRONG> 
  California could expand health coverage to uninsured children and potentially 
  other family members by making maximum use of unallocated federal funds, which 
  match state spending. Children's enrollment and coverage could be readily 
  expanded by making the following changes: <BR><BR></DT></DL>
<P></P>
<P></P>
<DL>
  <DT>• Make children automatically eligible for Medi-Cal and Healthy Families 
  when families are approved for supplemental food programs. </DT></DL>
<P>• Consider children who apply to Medi-Cal and Healthy Families to be 
presumptively eligible, and extend their Medi-Cal eligibility to 12 months 
before recertification is needed.</P>
<P>• Allow the same income deductions for both programs and cover recent 
immigrant children under Healthy Families, consistent with Medi-Cal policy.</P>
<P></P>
<P></P>
<DL>
  <DT><STRONG>2. Cover uninsured children from families with income up to 300% 
  of the poverty level using existing federal options.</STRONG> This would 
  include 88% of all uninsured children who are citizens or legal immigrants. 
  Expand programs to uninsured adults. Efforts that do not provide public 
  funding will not greatly increase the number of insured. Parents of uninsured 
  low-income children can be covered through allowable modifications of Medi-Cal 
  and Healthy Families. In addition, a Medicaid waiver would enable the 
  uninsured to buy into these programs on a sliding scale. </DT></DL>
<P></P>
<P></P>
<DL>
  <DT><BR><STRONG>3. Remove health care from welfare.</STRONG> Working families 
  should not have to grovel at the welfare office to obtain necessary health 
  care. All applications and eligibility screening should be handled by a state 
  agency administering the health care program, without welfare agency review. 
  This would save costs for determining eligibility, and help offset expanded 
  coverage costs. <BR><BR></DT></DL>
<P></P>
<P></P>
<DL>
  <DT><STRONG>4. Create a seamless system of public coverage.</STRONG> 
  California's different coverage programs are divided among several 
  agencies--all with different eligibility criteria and targeting populations 
  that often overlap. This patchwork creates unnecessary problems, leaves large 
  gaps in coverage, and adds costs for multiple bureaucracies. By integrating 
  programs and restructuring state agencies, we could create a seamless system 
  that will enable uninsured residents to meet their needs effectively and 
  efficiently. </DT></DL>
<P>Ultimately, creating a new "Healthy Californians Program" would reduce 
administrative costs; enable people to obtain information in one place and use 
one application, without stigma; and cover all family members within the same 
program, regardless of funding sources. These options will help us achieve the 
proposed state policy goal that "all Californians will have affordable health 
care coverage that provides good access to quality care."<BR></P>
