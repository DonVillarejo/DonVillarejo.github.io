<P><B><FONT size=+1>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</FONT></B> <BR>&nbsp; 
<P>This report summarizes the findings of a pilot study intended to assess the 
health status of a representative cross-section of agricultural employees in 
California. Of special interest were health outcomes linked to occupational 
exposures. The pilot study combined self-reported information obtained from a 
personal interview normally conducted at each subject's residence with the 
results of a rudimentary physical examination, and utilized an innovative 
sampling strategy. This method entailed a household survey modified to include 
mapping and listing all temporary or unconventional living quarters utilized by 
employees who may migrate to find seasonal jobs. The sampling strategy was 
specifically designed to take account of the well established fact that a 
sizable share of U.S. hired farm workers, estimated to be two out of every five, 
migrate throughout the year in search of employment. 
<P>In this paper we examine the results of the two parts of the Parlier Survey; 
a health survey and an enumeration survey conducted in mid-1992. The data 
obtained through the Parlier Survey is compared to other surveys of similar 
populations, in particular the 1990 U.S. Census of Population for Parlier and 
the National Agricultural Workers Survey (NAWS) for California. The Parlier 
Survey data is also analyzed and examined by type of housing. It is found that a 
significant proportion of Parlier's houses are substandard and lack recognized 
U.S. postal addresses, which make up the sampling frame of the U.S. Census of 
Population. Thus, the Parlier study finds a population invisible to the Census 
of Population and all other programs and studies which are based on it. 
<P>The Parlier Survey's findings support the conclusion that the sampling method 
achieved its goal of obtaining an accurately representative cross-section of the 
residents of the city of Parlier, including nomadic workers. Sub-groups which 
are usually not reliably represented in established household surveys, such as 
the U.S. Census of Population, appear to have been well represented in the 
Parlier Survey. This report discusses both the findings and their relationship 
to the sampling strategy. In particular, the successful inclusion of a more 
accurately drawn population of Parlier's nomadic workers profoundly influenced 
overall results. <BR>&nbsp; <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;
