<P align=center><B><FONT size=+1>Executive Summary</FONT></B> <BR></P>
<P>The 1987-92 California Drought substantially reduced the supply of federal 
and state irrigation water available to farmers in the Central Valley. Overall, 
the reduction amounted to more than 50 percent when the pre-drought period 
1984-86 is compared with the final years of the drought. </P>
<P>The Central Valley Improvement Act (CVPIA), passed in 1992, mandated a major 
shift of irrigation water from farms to urban and environmental restoration 
uses. The act is expected to affect the Central Valley in much the same way as 
the drought, and the areas hit hardest by the drought will likely be the most 
severely affected. Several independent reports of harvested cropland were used 
to determine the drought-related decline in harvested acres. It is estimated 
that approximately 176,700 acres were lost due to the drought. The greatest 
declines in harvested cropland were found in Fresno County, especially on the 
west side of the San Joaquin Valley. </P>
<P>Of all the crop categories, field and seed crops experienced the largest net 
decrease in harvested acres within the Central Valley Project service area. 
Harvested acreage for vegetable crops, however, grew during the same period, 
though the entire increase was accounted for by processing vegetable crops, 
especially tomatoes. Fresh vegetable acreage showed a net decrease; melon 
acreage was especially affected. </P>
<P>As a result of cutbacks in production, labor demand was reduced by an 
estimated 4 million hours, a decrease equivalent to 2,350 people working 
full-time. According to statewide employment reports, the impact was mixed; 
employment rates varied from county to county. Fresno County did witness a 
significant decline in on-farm employment, but, at the same time, the on-farm 
employment rate in Kern County rose. The western Fresno County community of 
Mendota was particularly affected: its official unemployment rate grew to 41 
percent. </P>
<P>While some of this increase may be attributed to California's recession, the 
effect of drought-induced cutbacks on hired farm workers has been substantial. 
Social and community impacts of new federal environmental laws, such as the 
CVPIA, must be determined prior to implementation, and mitigation measures must 
be developed and adopted. </P>
<P>In addition, sustainable farn-iing practices should be encouraged by 
recognizing irrigation as an environmentally sound use of water. Finally, more 
thorough measures of water use should be mandated, including water meters, if 
necessary. </P>
