<P><SPAN style="mso-ansi-language: EN-US"><FONT face=Arial>This report presents 
the findings of a study on the impact of the Reclamation Reform Act (RRA) passed 
in 1982.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>In instituting it, 
Congress attempted to limit the number of acres per farm that would qualify for 
federally subsidized irrigation water.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
</SPAN>Under the RRA, only farms 960 acres or less in size are eligible.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Although 17 western states have federal 
projects, it is only in California that very large farms have historically 
managed to evade reclamation acreage limits, so the impact of RRA, if enforced, 
will be strongest in California.&nbsp;<O:P> </O:P></FONT></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN style="mso-ansi-language: EN-US"><FONT face=Arial>Repeated attempts by 
Congress to mandate the enforcement of reclamation law have been 
unsuccessful.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Its implementation 
could have far reaching consequences, especially as a counterbalance to some of 
the institutional biases which favor large-scale farm operations.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Researchers have reported that the size 
of farms surrounding rural neighborhoods can affect the quality of life in the 
community.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Several studies have 
shown that the larger the farm size, the poorer the social conditions in the 
surrounding communities.&nbsp;<O:P> </O:P></FONT></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN style="mso-ansi-language: EN-US"><FONT face=Arial>Irrigation brings 
significant yield increases, and the subsidy from federal projects is 
considerable.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Unfortunately, 
policies of the Bureau of Reclamation have allowed few farm operations in 
California to reap most of the benefits of federally subsidized projects.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>While agriculture flourishes, much of 
the populace in the Central Valley live in poverty.&nbsp;<O:P> 
</O:P></FONT></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN style="mso-ansi-language: EN-US"><FONT face=Arial>The Westlands Water 
District (WWD) is one of the largest in California.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>This study concentrated on that district 
and found that, although WWD official reported a major restructuring of farms as 
a result of RRA, substantive changes had been minor.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>According to WWD, the number of farms 
had increased dramatically since 1980, and the size of farms had 
decreased.&nbsp;<O:P> </O:P></FONT></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN style="mso-ansi-language: EN-US"><FONT face=Arial>This study found that 
large landholders have been representing themselves as several small units even 
though their land was being managed as one operation.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>In fact, comparison of documents from 
different agencies showed that large farm operations often told WWD that they 
were many small units, while registering at other agenciesThia as one farm.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>These schemes involved 49% of land in 
WWD operated under RRA by only 50 different operations.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>When this data was taken into account, 
the average size of farming operations in WWD appeared to be at least 1,312 
acres, only slightly less than it had been in 1980, and nice times as large as 
the average irrigated farm in California. However, contrary to the intent of 
reclamation law, most of the acreage involved in these clusters was eligible for 
low-cost water.&nbsp;<O:P> </O:P></FONT></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN style="mso-ansi-language: EN-US"><FONT face=Arial>Although, as required 
by law, landowners owning more than their acreage limitation are being required 
to sell their excess land at prices that do not reflect the benefit of 
irrigation water, most of the land is being sold to farmers that already own 
land in Westlands.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>In some 
instances, as a result of these sales, the total holdings of individuals are 
taken above the new ownership limits.&nbsp;<O:P> </O:P></FONT></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN style="mso-ansi-language: EN-US"><FONT face=Arial>This research 
uncovered a pervasive pattern involving considerable effort on the part of large 
operations to comply with the technical requirements of RRA in order to receive 
low-cost water while circumventing the RRA goal of assisting family-scale 
farms.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Than these farms invested 
considerable funds in this process is a reflection of the economic significance 
of subsidized water.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Although these 
schemes may appear unscrupulous, and indeed do not reflect the intent of 
Congress, it is the current policy of the Bureau of Reclamation to encourage 
them.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Ultimately, it is the Bureau, 
not the farmers, that must be held accountable for these massive violations of 
its legal mandate and of the public interest.&nbsp;<O:P> 
</O:P></FONT></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN style="mso-ansi-language: EN-US"><FONT face=Arial>Several substantive 
changes in policy are needed to improve conditions in the Central Valley of 
California:&nbsp;<O:P> </O:P></FONT></SPAN></P>
