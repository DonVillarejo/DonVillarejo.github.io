<P>California's agriculture industry has experienced impressive growth in the 
last twenty years, growing faster than the nation's economy as a whole. This 
growth and the possible economic rewards have made farming an attractive 
venture. But at what risk, and what are the results for farmers both new and 
old? What are the factors that lead some farms to economic success and others to 
disaster? This report looks at these issues through examining farm operator 
turnover in two California counties, Fresno and Monterey. </P>
<P>Farm operator turnover as a concept can be accessed using two different 
measures, both of which are explored in this report. The first is attrition 
rates, which capture farm business closures during the five-year study period. 
The second measure is the turnover rate, which includes new farm ventures as 
well as farm closures during the study period. These two separate analyses were 
done by using the California Institute for Rural Studies (CIRS) Farm Operator 
data base as a source for longitudinal information on crop farm operators. </P>
<P>The study finds that yearly turnover is unexpectedly large and is 
quantitatively similar for the five-year interval in both counties. The 
attrition rate is somewhat smaller than the turnover rate, which includes farms 
not enumerated by the attrition rate. For Fresno County, the attrition rate is 
5.4% per year and the turnover rate is equivalent to 7.7% per year, implying a 
nominal 100% turnover of farm operators in Fresno County in just 13 years. 
Monterey County has an attrition rate of 6.2% per year and a turnover rate of 
10.8% per year, implying a nominal 100% farm operator turnover within 10 years. 
</P>
<P>Although these rates are quite high, a positive side can be seen from the 
turnover rate, which found 1,800 new farm start-ups during the five-year period 
in Fresno County, and 410 in Monterey County. These figures suggest that the 
economic growth of the agriculture industry is a great incentive to entering 
farming. However, as the attrition and turnover rates suggest, success is not 
always easily achieved. </P>
<P>Economic instability, although always present in farming, is more common in 
certain crops than in others. Annual crops, such as fresh market green beans, 
tomatoes and strawberries were found to have higher attrition rates than those 
for perennial crops. In addition, smaller farms were found to have much higher 
attrition rates than larger farms, suggesting a strong correlation between farm 
size and economic stability. Thus those farms whose inputs are the lowest, i.e. 
farms with small amounts of land planted in annual crops, also run the highest 
risk of failure. </P>
<P>Economic instability is further analyzed in detail for Monterey's strawberry 
industry, where newcomers are likely to be of Latino/Hispanic origin and plant 
medium sized farms. However, the attrition rates show that the likelihood of 
succeeding as a strawberry farmer is greatest among non-Hispanic, large acreage 
farms, and is least among small Hispanic-owned farms. </P>
<P>Thus the report's main finding is that high turnover rates exist alongside 
the substantial economic growth of the agricultural industries of these two 
counties. An explanation for this is that farming appears attractive to the 
entrepreneur despite being extremely risky for the newcomer who cannot afford 
high input costs. In Monterey County, nearly as many new farmers entered the 
business as left, and in Fresno four new farms started up for every five that 
quit the business. Clearly there exists a strong interest in farming as an 
economic venture. However outreach is needed to aid new farmers, and lending 
practices and resource policies should help encourage, not discourage these 
farmers in order to insure that California agriculture remains a healthy and 
growing industry while still being accessible to the small-scale 
entrepreneur.<BR></P>
