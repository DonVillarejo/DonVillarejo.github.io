<P>This report summarizes findings of a study designed to test the efficacy of a 
voluntary pesticide reduction program in California almonds and walnuts. We 
compared two groups of tree nut growers. First, a group of growers who are 
members of the Biologically Integrated Orchard Systems (BIOS) program sponsored 
by the Community Alliance with Family Farmers (CAFF); and second, a group of 
growers of the same crop who were carefully selected to serve as a cohort to the 
first group. The matching procedure involved identifying a producer who farms a 
nut orchard located within the same section of land as the BIOS grower (a 
section of land has an area of one square mile and contains 640 acres), and 
whose orchard is comparable in size to the BIOS farmer. In addition, an effort 
was made to match the BIOS farmer with a cohort grower who operates the same 
total number of nut crop acres. </P>
<P>Cohort Orchards were carefully selected to match, on a pairwise basis, BIOS 
Orchards for both almonds and walnuts. It was found that pairs of orchards could 
be matched using location, orchard size, and farm size criteria. Interviews with 
both groups revealed that the BIOS and Cohort Orchards were also well matched in 
terms of tree density and age of trees. This latter finding was unintentional 
but highly desirable. </P>
<P>Pesticide use reports (PURs) for all BIOS and Cohort Orchards were obtained 
and examined in detail. From these individual PURs it proved possible to examine 
actual amounts of pesticides reportedly used on a field-by-field basis. 
Determinations were made of the number of orchard fields treated, the number of 
applications per orchard field treated, the amount of all pesticides applied in 
each field treated and of the amount of restricted materials applied. </P>
<P>This study finds that, uniformly, BIOS Orchards report a significantly lower 
proportion of fields treated with registered pesticides as compared with a 
matched group of Cohort Orchard fields. The share of all BIOS Orchard fields 
treated with any registered material has significantly declined throughout the 
period in which the BIOS programs have been implemented. In the case of almonds, 
this share is now less than one-half; in walnuts about one-fourth. </P>
<P>Second, substantially lower intensities of pesticide use are reported in BIOS 
Orchards than is the case for the matched Cohort Orchards. In almonds, the BIOS 
Orchards report a steady decrease in the intensity of pesticide use for the 
period 1993-95 and also in comparison with levels reported in 1990. However, in 
walnuts, where only a small share of all BIOS Orchards is reportedly treated, 
there has been no significant change in the intensity of pesticide use. However, 
it should be emphasized that pesticide use in BIOS walnut orchards is extremely 
low and very much lower than in the Cohort Orchards. </P>
<P>Finally, greater pesticide use is associated with obtaining pest control 
advice from Chemical Company Representatives, whereas lower pesticide use is 
associated with seeking pest control advice from Independent PCAs and members of 
the BIOS Management Team. </P>
