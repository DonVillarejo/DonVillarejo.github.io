<P align=center><B><FONT size=+1>Executive Summary</FONT></B> </P>
<P>For nearly seventy-five years, irrigated agriculture in the arid West was the 
dominant concern of federal water policy. Today, water policy is driven by a new 
environmental ethic. Both increased population and concern for enviormental 
restoration, as well as long-term sustainability, have begun to shift water 
allocations away from agriculture to urban and enviormental uses. </P>
<P>Some policy analysts have suggested that both through reallocation of 
existing supplies and water marketing, agriculturalists will find that limited 
water availability will encourage increased attention to conservation. Higher 
market prices for water will force farmers to reconsider traditional cropping 
patterns, reducing plantings of low-value, water-intensive crops, such as field 
grain and forage commodities, and increasing their fruit, vegetable and 
ornamental horticultural crop production. </P>
<P>There has been relatively little attention to the impact of irrigation water 
reductions on farm communities, especially on indiviudal farmers, farmworkers 
and townspeople. California is the nation's most important agricultural state, 
and some 750,000 persons are employed on its farms in course of a single year. 
Most of California crop production is on irrigated land and the Central Valley 
Improvement Act mandated changes in how the state's developed water supply will 
be allocated. </P>
<P>This study seeks to determine the actual, direct impacts of irrigation water 
reduction on a community that is almost entirely dependent on farming: the 
Fresno County city of Mendota (bounded by the zip code, 93640). Its geographic 
isolation on the Westside of the San Joaquin Valley and its strong dependence on 
surface water devilveries from the Central Valley Project make it an ideal 
setting for examining these impacts. The six-year (1987-92) drought and the very 
large reductions in Westside deliveries created an opportunity for this 
research. </P>
<P>The main findings of this research are that during the six year drought, in 
the Mendota Area: 
<UL>
  <P>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;irrigated cropland decreased by 14% as a result of 
  cutbacks in water deliveries; </P>
  <P>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;farmers susbstituted pumped groundwater for the lost 
  surface deliveries whenever possible; </P>
  <P>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the poor quality of pumped groundwater led to reduced 
  yields in crops that are especially sensitive to salts; </P>
  <P>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the largest decrease in crop production were in 
  vegatables, especially melons (-37%), and only small decreases occurred in 
  field crop plantings (-5%); </P>
  <P>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;labor demand decreased by an amount that was 
  proportionately larger than the decrease in cropland acreage; </P>
  <P>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;packing, shipping and hauling labor demand also 
  decreased by a large factor, reflecting the decrease in fresh produce crop 
  production; </P>
  <P>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;farm packing wage and salary income in the Mendota Area 
  declined by an estimated $4.8 million (-14%); </P>
  <P>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3 of 7 Mendota Area wholsesale produce firms went out 
  of business or left the area during the drought; </P>
  <P>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there was a net decrease of 18 farms (-26%); </P>
  <P>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;70% of small farms active at the beginning of the 
  drought either quit farming or left the area; </P>
  <P>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mendota is a very poor community, overwhelmingly 
  Hispanic/Latina(o), with low levels of educationsal attainment; </P>
  <P>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;retail sales experienced an 11% decrease as compared to 
  a 5% increase of county-wide retail sales; </P>
  <P>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;agricultural land values declined by 30%, comparing 
  poorly to increases of land values in many other Fresno County farm towns; 
</P>
  <P>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mendota City tax revenues declined both as a result of 
  depressed business conditions and declining property values.</P></UL>
<P>The failure of environmental policy to address the community impacts of 
irrigation water reductions is identified as a major short-coming of the new 
water ethic. As in the case of worker dislocations resulting from new forestry 
or fishery management practices, programs need to be developed to address the 
effects of water relocation. </P>
<P>The people and community of Mendota will require the assistance of 
knowledgeable and culturally-sensitive rural economic development specialists. 
On-the-ground demonstration strategies will be needed. Securing available 
grants, designation as a rural enterprise zone or other similiar strategies 
require the development of human capital at the community level. The Cooperative 
Extension Service is poorly equipped the address this challenge. </P>
<P>A new rural development initiative is needed to address the predominately 
Hispanic/Latina(o) communitites of Mendota. The city could be made into a model 
community demonstrating how the transition to reduced irrigation water supplies 
can be made without causing undue hardship on farmers, farmworkers and 
townspeople. </P>
