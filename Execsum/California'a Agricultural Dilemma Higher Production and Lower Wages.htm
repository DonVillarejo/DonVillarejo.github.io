<P align=center><B><FONT size=+1>Executive Summary</FONT></B> 
<BR><BR>California's annual production of fruits, vegetables and horticultural 
crops has grown significantly in recent years. Increases in the supply have 
out-stripped demand for some crops which, in turn, has led to financial 
instability within some firms, mainly vegetable and wine grape producers. 
Production growth also has increased labor requirements. It is estimated that 
labor demand in California agriculture has risen by twenty percent over the past 
fifteen years. </P>
<P>At the same time, the farm worker population has expanded in number, largely 
as a result of new immigration. The Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 
clearly stimulated a substantial influx of immigrants, both authorized and 
unauthorized. Today more than nine out of every ten California farm workers are 
foreign-born; most are from Mexico. Just eight out of one hundred workers are 
U.S. born. </P>
<P>This new immigration has both broadened and deepened among the peoples of 
Mexico and increasingly, Central America. A large population of indigenous 
migrants now can be found working in California's fields. </P>
<P>As the number of farmers and unpaid family members working in agriculture 
steadily decrease, and California's farms become increasingly dominated by large 
businesses, our state's agriculture becomes more and more dependent on hired 
workers. Today, at least eighty percent of all the work on California farms is 
performed by hired labor. </P>
<P>The single most important recent development in farm employment is the 
growing use of farm labor contractors. At least one in three California farm 
workers is employed by a labor contractor during the year. At peak season, a 
majority of San Joaquin Valley farm workers in fruits and vegetables works for a 
labor contractor. </P>
<P>The number of workers in California agriculture is difficult to estimate, but 
wage reports submitted by employers identify some 881,000 different people 
(actually Social Security numbers) employed in agricultural jobs each year. 
Annual average employment is quite a bit lower since most workers experience 
long periods of unemployment between jobs. Most agricultural work -- some ninety 
percent -- is performed by people who piece together a series of jobs, usually 
interspersed with periods of no work. Very little work is done by people who 
enter the labor force for only a short period during the peak of the season. The 
notion of the "seasonal worker" is largely a myth. </P>
<P>Roughly four of ten California farm workers migrate to find employment. Most 
are young, have an average of just six years of formal education, earn about 
$6,500 per year, and do not make much use of government-supported services. </P>
<P>Finally, evidence strongly supports the existence of a substantial labor 
surplus in California agriculture. Correlated with this is a significant decline 
in wage rates and an even larger drop in annual earnings. </P>
<P>Unions and other organizations directly representing current farm workers 
have seen their numbers and influence decline. The large labor surplus, combined 
with continuing immigration, form daunting obstacles to organizing efforts. </P>
